"How to survive the verification of the latest generation of automotive system on chip","Laroche, Arnaud; Kirscher, Jerome","Infineon Technologies Austria Villach, Austria","Specification & Design Languages (FDL), 2013 Forum on","24-26 Sept. 2013","2013","","","1","7","The new level of integration achieved by the latest generation of automotive power chips pushes the pre-silicon verification challenges a step further. To cope with these challenges, the proven mixed-signal verification methodologies which have hitherto been used successfully have to be extended. The paper introduces newly applied approaches along with verification simulation results of the latest automotive power circuit generation.","1636-9874","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6646629","Automotive System On Chip;Multi-Abstraction;Pre-Silicon Venfication;Real Valued Modeling;Spectre;Top Level Simulation;VHDL;Verilog-AMS","Accuracy;Automotive engineering;Hardware design languages;Integrated circuit modeling;Load modeling;Sensitivity;System-on-chip","","","","","","0","","","","","20131028","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Model-based progressive design and verification of an integrated CMOS magnetic sensor for automotive applications","Close, G.F.; de Jong, G.","Melexis Technol., Bevaix, Switzerland","Specification and Design Languages (FDL), 2012 Forum on","18-20 Sept. 2012","2012","","","239","245","This paper presents a case study of the concrete usages and benefits of model-based design and verification applied to the development of an integrated sensor. The Hall-effect sensor is to be implemented in CMOS technology and to provide gear-tooth detection for automotive applications. A transaction-level mixed-signal model written in SystemVerilog is introduced. The model covers the key functional aspects of the sensor. The model being architecturally accurate allows the progressive system integration and verification of the implemented blocks, such as synthesis-ready RTL, compiled embedded software and analog transistor-level schematics. The model is shown to serve multiple purposes throughout the IC design and verification phase, overall shortening the IC development time. Furthermore the model is used in a systems in system context by the Tier 1 OEM to confirm the system concept phase and specifications, and in hardware and software in the loop application integration phases.","1636-9874","978-1-4673-1240-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337018","Hall-effect sensor;SystemVerilog;Transaction-level model;Verilog-AMS;functional verification;progressive integration","Hardware design languages;Integrated circuit modeling;Magnetic domains;Semiconductor device modeling;Software;Temperature sensors;Wheels","CMOS integrated circuits;Hall effect devices;automotive electronics;computerised instrumentation;gears;magnetic sensors;mechanical engineering computing","CMOS technology;IC design phase;IC verification phase;SystemVerilog;Tier 1 OEM;analog transistor-level schematics;automotive applications;compiled embedded software;gear-tooth detection;hardware-in-the-loop application integration phases;integrated CMOS magnetic sensor;model-based progressive design;model-based progressive verification;progressive system integration;progressive system verification;software-in-the-loop application integration phases;synthesis-ready RTL;system concept phase;system concept specifications;transaction-level mixed-signal model","","","","0","","13","","","20121025","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
