"A Methodology and a Tool to Design of Mixed-Signal Technology","da Silva, A.C.R.; Grout, I.","UNESP, Sao Paulo","Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference, 2007. CERMA 2007","25-28 Sept. 2007","2007","","","164","169","This paper presents a tool box developed to read files describing a SIMULINK<sup>reg</sup> model and translates it into a structural VHDL-AMS description. In translation process, all files and directory structures to simulate the translated model on SystemVisiontrade environment is generate. The tool box named ""MS<sup>2</sup>SV"" was tested by three models of commercially available digital-to-analogue converters. All models use the R- 2R ladder network to conversion, but the functionality of these three components is different. The methodology of conversion of the model is presents together with sort theory about R-2R ladder network. In the evaluation of the translated models, we used a sine waveform input signal and the waveform generated by D/A conversion process was compared by FFT analysis. The results show the viability of this type of approach. This work considers some of challenges set by the electronic industry for the further development of simulation methodologies and tools in the field of mixed-signal technology.","","978-0-7695-2974-5","","10.1109/CERMA.2007.4367679","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4367679","","Analog-digital conversion;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Digital signal processing;Electronic design automation and methodology;Mathematical model;Power system modeling;Robots;Signal analysis;Signal generators","digital-analogue conversion;fast Fourier transforms;hardware description languages;ladder networks;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","D-A conversion;FFT analysis;MS<sup>2</sup>SV tool box;R- 2R ladder network;SIMULINK model;SystemVision environment;digital-to-analogue converters;electronic industry;mixed-signal technology;sine waveform input signal;sort theory;structural VHDL-AMS description","","","","2","","13","","","20071029","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
