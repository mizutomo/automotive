Such a formal language is well-suited for a design process that employs formal techniques and supports hardware/software synthesis. On the other hand, SystemC is a widely used system level design language with hardware-oriented modeling features. It provides a desirable simulation framework for system architecture design and exploration. This paper presents a design framework, called SysCOLA, that makes use of the unique advantages of both a new formal modeling language, COLA, and SystemC, and allows for parallel development of application software and system platform. In SysCOLA, function design and architecture exploration are done in the COLA based modeling environment and the SystemC based virtual prototyping environment, respectively. Our concepts of abstract platform and virtual platform abstraction layer facilitate the orthogonalization of functionality and architecture by means of mapping and integration in the respective environments. As SysCOLA is targeted at the automotive domain, the whole design approach is showcased using a case study of designing an automotive system.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227204","COLA;System modeling;SystemC;Virtual prototyping","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Embedded system;Hardware;Modeling;Permission;Process design;Software systems;Virtual prototyping","automotive engineering;formal specification;hardware-software codesign;software architecture;software prototyping;specification languages;traffic engineering computing;virtual prototyping","SysCOLA;SystemC;application software;automotive software development;formal language;formal semantics;formal techniques;hardware-oriented modeling;hardware-software synthesis;modeling language;parallel development;system architecture design;system architecture exploration;system functionality;system level design language;system platform development;virtual platform abstraction layer;virtual prototyping","","","","0","","16","","","20090828","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the add-on SystemC Verification Library (SCV) elemental constrained-random stimuli techniques may be used for verification. However, SCV has several drawbacks such as lack of functional coverage. In this paper we present a functional coverage library that implements parts of the IEEE 1800-2005 SystemVerilog standard and allows capturing functional coverage throughout the design and verification process with SystemC.

In this paper, we propose two new approaches to integrate assertions in the verification of embedded software using simulation-based verification. Firstly, we extended a SystemC hardware temporal checker with interfaces in order to monitor the embedded software variables and functions that are stored in a microprocessor memory model. Secondly, we derived a SystemC model from the original C program in order to integrate directly with the SystemC temporal checker.

The idea is, at the highest levels of the design procedure, to be able to assess the observability degree of the aimed system. Our approach is based on the analysis of the system simulation results. It allows checking the observability property in a real time electronic system in order to improve its diagnosis capacity.To reach this objective, we have set up an iterative modeling process. The model of the real time electronic system represents the input for the simulation step, which precedes the property checking. It is possible to model the system in two different ways: either with a combined architectural and functional modeling using SystemC, or solely functional modeling using Matlab/Simulink. Then, we check the observability property of the system, if it is not verified, our contribution consists in adding a feedback to the modeling step to improve the model. Otherwise, we validate the result through a test in an electronic automotive platform using as input the Simulink model used for the simulation step.","1550-6525","978-0-7695-3425-1","","10.1109/DS-RT.2008.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700105","Observability;co-simulation;comodeling;property checking;real time system diagnosis","Analytical models;Automotive applications;Electronic components;Electronic equipment testing;Embedded system;Feedback;Mathematical model;Observability;Process design;Real time systems","electronic engineering computing;iterative methods;mathematics computing;observability","Matlab-Simulink;SystemC;electronic embedded system;iterative modeling process;observability checking;property checking;real time electronic system diagnosis","","","","2","","23","","","20081208","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The component models presented (60 GHz communication channel, QPSK RF transceiver, CMOS video sensor, digital microcontroller, simplified car kinetic engine) are written in SystemC and its analog Mixed-Signal extensions, SystemC-AMS, and belong to five distinct yet highly interwoven disciplines: newtonian mechanics, op to-electronics, analog RF, digital and embedded software. The paper clearly exhibits the complex multi-discipline feed- back loop of this automotive application and the related model composability issues. Using the opto-electrical stimulus and the received RF inter-vehicle data, a car is able to exploit its environmental data to autonomously adjust its own velocity. This adjustment impacts the physical environment that in turns modifies the RF communication conditions.

Proceedings","16-20 Feb. 2004","2004","3","","268","273 Vol.3","In this paper we present results in using the new object-oriented design approach OSSS (ODETTE system synthesis subset). The methodology and tools of the ODETTE (object-oriented co-design and functional test techniques) project have been developed within the context of the IST programme of the European Commission. Main focus of OSSS lies in the field of hardware design and in synthesis capability. The strategy is based on an extension of the synthesizable subset of standard systemC. The approach supports real object-oriented and synthesizable design features like classes, inheritance, templates, polymorphism and global object access. Therefore OSSS promises high efficiency in sense of capability to handle complex designs, faster development time, improved code quality and faster time to market. In contrast, standard systemC is also based on C++ constructs, but no object-oriented constructs are available yet for a synthesizable system description. We have evaluated OSSS on an automotive design example. It was chosen for the implementation of a component that is part of all video projects: A camera's exposure control unit (ExpoCU). The first main goal that was achieved is a synthesizable design by the automatic generation of an FPGA netlist from an OSSS description. Furthermore we have also proved the methodology to fulfill industrial requirements such as usability for complex system development, integration of existing IP, improved code quality and decreased development effort. Comparison will be done against existing VHDL based design flow. We especially focus on the implementation and testability by comparing the new object-oriented synthesis approach with a standard VHDL flow by laying emphasis on synthesizability. OSSS and equivalent kinds of methodology show a large potential to handle new generations of complex HW-SW systems. Moreover the gap between increasing design complexity and available methodologies already now gets bigger and bigger and thus needs to be closed by new solutions such as OSSS.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269247","","Automatic control;Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Design methodology;Electrical equipment industry;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Testing;Time to market","C++ language;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;object-oriented methods","C++ constructs;FPGA netlist;ODETTE system synthesis subset;VHDL based design flow;automotive design;cameras exposure control unit;complex system development;field programmable gate array;global object access;hardware description languages;object oriented codesign and functional test techniques;object oriented hardware design;polymorphism;standard systemC","","","","0","","14","","","20040308","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network/platform model in SystemC forms the backbone of the virtual prototyping, which bridges control software and physical environment.

In this paper we present a novel approach to verify embedded software running on a microprocessor model, based on a coverage driven verification technique. We have combined a new application called generic software adapter with a SystemC PowerPC microprocessor model in order to cover difficult corner case scenarios in embedded software.

In recent years, ambitious efforts at increasing the abstraction level of formal design languages have been presented in order to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, certain parts of all systems still have to be described in detail. Unfortunately, even small analog parts can slow down a global system simulation significantly. It is therefore necessary to generate abstract models with reduced but adequate result accuracy for these ldquobottleneckrdquo components. This paper presents a novel approach to the automated generation and evaluation of abstract behavioural models for automotive applications. Our methodology aims at achieving a convincing speedup in global system verification by accelerating the transient simulation of the crucial analog and mixed-signal components. The speedup results not only from an increased level of abstraction but also from a fast generation of circuit equations without the need for numerical integration. The approach is able to handle nonlinear circuits by employing piecewise linear models. The use of a SystemC interface will allow effortless integration into manifold simulation environments.","","978-1-4244-2264-7","","10.1109/FDL.2008.4641424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641424","","Acceleration;Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Circuit simulation;Design methodology;Hardware design languages;Microelectronics;Nonlinear circuits;Nonlinear equations;Safety","automobiles;formal languages;piecewise linear techniques;user interfaces","HDL-based design;SystemC interface;analog-mixed-signal components;automotive domain;bottleneck components;circuit equations;global system simulation;global system verification;high-level modelling;nonlinear circuits;piecewise linear models;transient simulation","","","","2","","15","","","20081010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach introduces a methodology to automatically configure system components with regards to the memory mapping of modules. The approach reduces the implementation effort that in conventional approaches has to be done by hand to re-assign and re-configure modules in a system. This does not only save time for manual adaptation but also reduces the chance to introduce errors like known from complex manual modifications. The new approach for automatic system configuration is derived as one of the results and features that come along with the module-adapter (MA) based approach that we have proposed in different presentations (Bannow, 2004). One of the main goals, our proposed methodology has to fulfill, are industrial requirements such as applicability for complex system development, integration of existing IP, improved code quality and decreased development effort.

Particular strengths of Simulink are rapid design and algorithm exploration. Moreover, commercial tools are available to generate embedded C or HDL code directly from a Simulink model. On the other hand, Simulink models are purely functional models and, hence, designers cannot seamlessly consider the architecture that a Simulink model is later implemented on. In particular, it is not possible to explore the different architectural alternatives and investigate the arising interactions and side-effects directly within Simulink. To benefit from Matlab/Simulink's algorithm exploration capabilities and overcome the outlined drawbacks, this work introduces a model transformation framework that converts a Simulink model to an executable specification, written in an actor-oriented modeling language. This specification then serves as the input of well-established Electronic System Level (ESL) design flows that, e. g., enables Design Space Exploration (DSE) and automatic code generation for both hardware and software. We also present a validation technique that considers the functional correctness by comparing the original Simulink model with the generated specification in a co-simulation environment. The co-simulation can also be used to evaluate the performance of implementation candidates during DSE. As case study, we present and investigate a torque vectoring application from an electric automotive vehicle.","1636-9874","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6646658","Actor-oriented Design;Code Generation;DSE;Matlab/Simulink;System-level Validation;SystemC","Computational modeling;Generators;Hardware;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers);Registers;Software packages","","","","","","0","","","","","20131028","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address this problem by constructing a UML-based design framework which exposes the essential features of the time-triggered platforms at the UML-level and allows applications to be developed at a more abstract level before full implementation. To support preliminary functional validation, we have constructed a translator by which SystemC code can be automatically generated from UML designs. Our framework enables fast prototyping of time-triggered applications and early design validation. It also supports key design principles of TTAs, such as temporal firewalls and composability.","1052-8725","978-0-7695-3062-8","","10.1109/RTSS.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408290","","Aerospace safety;Application software;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer architecture;Protocols;Prototypes;Real time systems;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;safety-critical software;software architecture","SystemC code;UML-based design framework;safety-critical real-time applications;time-triggered applications;time-triggered architectures","","","","0","","35","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
