The first approach involves the use of the SysML based tool Artisan Studio whilst the second approach involves the use of the MATLAB tools Simulink and Stateflow.

"An integrated environment for simulation and modelling","Kennedy, A.; Raistrick, C.","","Tools for Simulation and Modelling (Ref. No. 2000/043), IEE Seminar on","2000","2000","","","2/1","2/4","It is now widely accepted in the automotive electronics industry that the scale and complexity of the software content in cars is destined for dramatic increase in the coming five years, fuelled by intense competitive pressures. Kennedy Carter, along with its partners in two EU-funded research programs, has accepted the challenge of creating the definitive integrated development environment for embedded automotive software for the first decade of this century (2000-2010). The vision that informs these two projects is the need for an integrated development environment conforming to an open systems/software architecture. Part of that vision is that the algorithmic, control theoretic emphasis of much software development in the automotive industry hitherto will not be sufficient to manage the scale and complexity of the software challenge that the industry faces. Thus, tools such as MATRIXx and MatLab must be augmented by tools which have been proven in large scale telecommunications and aerospace projects and which support the separation of concerns, rapid prototyping, co-design and code generation. Kennedy Carter is now able to offer an integrated development environment (IDE), comprising the I-UML, I-SIM/RT and I-CCG products. Used in conjunction with MATRIXx from Integrated Systems, or MatLab/Simulink from The Mathworks, these products are able to realise the vision. The result is a development environment that offers comprehensive and flexible support for automotive system development","","","","10.1049/ic:20000227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848156","","","","","","","","0","1","","","","20020806","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

In traditional design approaches the different parts are designed by separate groups and the integration of the overall system is made at the final stage. This scheme may induce extra delays and costs because of interfacing problems. The paper presents a new automotive system design approach that offers many advantages including efficient design flow and shorter time to market. The key idea of our approach is to allow for early validation of the overall system through co-simulation. The design starts with a high level specification of each part. In our approach, software is described in C, hardware is described in VHDL and mechanical parts are described in MATLAB. A C-VHDL-MATLAB co-simulation is then used for functional validation of the initial specification. During the design process, the hardware and software parts may be refined using specific techniques and tools. The refinement steps are also validated through co-simulation. In this approach we use two kinds of co-simulation: untimed co-simulation is used for functional validation and timed co-simulation for real time validation.

The design procedure meets difficulties and solves them in manner of core saturation at high current and high power density. The analytical design procedure is detailed for the proposed machine. Discussing of high phase currents, a validation of the design needs to be approached, based on FEA method. The direct instantaneous torque control (DITC) is employed as the machine is addressed to automotive applications. As it is known that the torque ripples of the SRM are high when using only hysteresis control of the currents hence these will create discomfort to the driver. With DITC, the torque can be smoothened in order to obtain increased comfort of the passenger. In order to implement DITC method, a Matlab Simulink program was created to simulate the SRM, based on lookup tables containing the flux and torque variations function the current and rotor position, fetched from the FEA model of the machine.

The three control techniques are implemented using PWM voltage modulation. The comparison is based on various criteria including: the motor dynamic performance, the speed and torque ripples, the ac current harmonic content, the control algorithm implementation complexity, the ZSI performance and the overall system efficiency.

Preventive actions have to be taken in respect of safety and reliability. An automatic and tool supported check of custom rules, industry standards and enterprise wide guidelines can support the quality assurance process. In the domain of automotive software engineering there is a lack of automatic checking for standard conformance. Especially, a formal and tool independent notation of rules to follow is missing. In this paper, the model-based development of automotive vehicle functions with the tools MATLAB, Simulink and Stateflow is taken as an example to show how textual rules describing standards to be met can be transformed into a formal notation using the open standards MOF and OCL.

Research and industry have investigated the issue, how to derive test cases to cover test requirements within minimal time. For the automation of all activities related to testing tool support is available. Yet, one question is getting increasingly difficult: How to derive good, i.e. significant test cases, embracing requirements from an external perspective and incorporating knowledge about the internal design and architecture of the system under test (SUT). In this paper we present the use of internal dependences and implementation metrics in combination with an exterior view on the basis of requirements with the aim to profile the test model for the generation of good, i.e. significant test cases. The incorporation of different sources of knowledge of the SUT into test generation reduces the effort to determine test cases for different test goals independently while recreating the knowledge of the SUT in each test process step. We applied the method to a real implementation of automotive functionality in the thermal control unit of a German OEM, that was designed in Matlab Simulink and architectured in AUTOSAR 3.2. The existing test suites were linked with the internal dependences of the Matlab Code, as to assess the reachability of the existing test cases already on the implementation model. In a next step, model metrics were calculated for the implementation modules. They were set into relation with the test cases and code coverage. In doing so, we profiled the test cases and assessed the significance and expressiveness of the model metrics.","","","","10.1109/SIES.2013.6601492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601492","AUTOSAR;Centrality;Component-Dependency-Model;Cyclomatic Complexity;Matlab;Metrics;Simulink;Test Profiling;Thermal Control System;Usage Model","Analytical models;Complexity theory;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Measurement;Testing","automatic test software;automotive engineering;embedded systems;program testing;software architecture;software metrics","AUTOSAR 3.2;German OEM;Matlab Code;Matlab Simulink;SUT architecture;SUT design;automotive functionality;complex multiple functionality devices;component dependency models;embedded systems;implementation metrics;internal dependences;model metrics;system under test;test case determination;test case reachability;test generation;test model;test profiling;test requirements;testing tool support;thermal control unit;usage models","","","","0","","22","","","20130919","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second application proposes the using of the BZSI in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) applications for replacing the bidirectional battery charger, which composed of two stages conversion. By using the BSZI, the battery can be charged from the grid during night and can be discharged to the grid during peak power demand, which increase the grid stability.

The overall learning and design phases proceeded quickly due to the use of the sisotool graphical user interface (GU) in Matlab's control system toolbox. The aim of this project was to create an HIL and human-in-the-loop driving simulator for testing vehicle dynamics control algorithms, examining the effect of a steer-by-wire actuator on vehicle dynamics control (VDC) performance, investigating driver-controller interaction, and eventually for driver modeling.","1066-033X","","","10.1109/MCS.2004.1337870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337870","","Assembly;Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Design automation;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Libraries;Mathematical model;Vehicle dynamics","automobiles;computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;control engineering education;control system synthesis;digital simulation;vehicle dynamics;velocity control","automation lab;automotive controls;driver-controller interaction;human-in-the-loop driving simulator;idle-speed controller;mean value engine model;senior projects;sisotool graphical user interface;steer-by-wire actuator;vehicle dynamics control;virtual engine","","","","1","","","","","20041004","","IEEE","","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By analyzing the operating characteristics of the 14 V Lundell alternator system with conventional three-phase full-bridge diode rectifier, the conditions for maximum output power at various alternator driving speeds are determined. Whereas in a conventional alternator-rectifier system the maximum power output on a wide operating speed range is obtained at working voltages below 42 V, the paper proposes the modification of the conventional system by introducing a boost converter. The operating characteristics of the new system are analyzed by performing simulations using the MATLAB SIMULINK programming environment.","","978-1-4244-1544-1","978-1-4244-1545-8","10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4602420","","Alternators;Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Batteries;Diodes;MATLAB;Performance analysis;Power generation;Rectifiers;Voltage","alternators;automotive electronics;mathematics computing;rectifying circuits","Lundell alternator;MATLAB SIMULINK;automotive supply system;conventional alternator;full bridge diode rectifier;maximum output power;rectifier system;voltage 14 V;voltage 42 V","","","","2","","10","","","20080819","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the instability effect of the negative incremental resistance phenomena of CPLs, several criteria have been investigated to ensure system stability in the presence of large amount of CPLs. With an increasing share of CPLs, the same negative incremental resistance phenomena can be the source of instability in AC distribution systems, especially in the event of voltage disturbances. The literature on AC systems has not yet addressed this problem in a comprehensive way, and more research effort will be required around the topic. This paper investigates the effect of the negative incremental resistance phenomena in AC distribution systems with large share of CPLs, and proposes an approach for mitigation of instability in presence of large signal disturbances based on injection of reactive current by active rectifiers interfacing the CPLs. Results from a simulation study with Matlab suggest how stability can be improved by reactive compensation and that distributed injection of reactive current by the CPLs might be more effective than a centralized compensation by a STATCOM.","","978-1-4244-1665-3","978-1-4244-1666-0","10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677119","","Automatic voltage control;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Electric resistance;Mathematical model;Nose;Power system stability;Rectifiers;Stability criteria;Steady-state","distribution networks;power grids;power system stability;reactive power;static VAr compensators","AC distribution systems;Matlab;STATCOM;active rectifiers;automotive systems;constant power load;electric ships;isolated power systems;power system stability;reactive compensation;reactive current;signal disturbances;spacecrafts;voltage disturbances","","","","9","","22","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is seen that tests that target a range of defect models, each with moderately high levels of coverage, may be better in terms of lowering PPM than those that target a single fault model with high levels of coverage.

As a result, there has been a lot of recent interest in timing and predictability analysis techniques that are specifically targeted towards FlexRay. In this paper we propose a compositional performance analysis framework for a network of electronic control units (ECUs) that communicate via a FlexRay bus. Given a specification of the tasks running on the different ECUs, the scheduling policy used at each ECU, and a specification of the FlexRay bus (e.g. slot sizes and message priorities), our framework can answer questions related to the maximum end-to-end delay experienced by any message, the amount of buffer required at each communication controller and the utilization of the different ECUs and the bus. In contrast to previous timing analysis techniques which analyze the FlexRay bus in isolation, our framework is fully compositional and allows the modeling of the schedulers at the ECUs and the FlexRay protocol in a seamless manner. As a result, it can be used to analyze large systems and does not involve any computationally expensive step like solving an ILP (which previous approaches require). We illustrate our framework using detailed examples and also present results from a Matlab-based implementation.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261192","Automotive electronics;Bus protocols;Design;FlexRay;Performance","Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer languages;Delay;Mathematical model;Performance analysis;Processor scheduling;Protocols;Size control;Timing","automotive electronics;protocols","communication controller;compositional performance analysis framework;end-to-end delay;flexray-based electronic control units;invehicle automotive communication systems;performance analysis;predictability analysis techniques;predominant protocol","","","","9","","","","","20070625","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

During the calculation of heat radiation intensity across the mould surface, we will use experimental measured values for the heat radiation intensity from a sensor in proximity to an infrared heater. It is necessary to maintain approximately the same heat radiation intensity across the whole mould surface during warming process. The model described in this article allows us to optimize the infrared heaters' location for this purpose. In this way, we obtain the same material structure and color tone across the whole surface of an artificial leather. We will apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the heaters' location.

The use of a coherent multi-dimensional model across all development phases enables model-based design to generate systems that are correct by construction. Even some commercial support is available for code generation from higher-level models. However, such code generation capabilities are usually limited to uniprocessor targets and to a limited range of operating environments. SysWeaver (previously called Time Weaver) is a model-based development tool that includes a flexible syscode generation scheme for distributed real-time systems that can be easily tailored to a wide range of target platforms. In this paper, we present our work on creating an interoperable toolchain to automatically generate complete runtime code using models. The toolchain includes a simulation tool (Matlab) and its code generator (Embedded Coder) along with SysWeaver. In this chain, the functional aspects of the system are specified in Simulink, Matlabs modeling language, and translated into a SysWeaver model to be enhanced with timing information, the target hardware model and its communication dependencies. The final runtime code is then generated, automatically integrating the functional code generated with Embedded Coder and SysWeavers syscode. This syscode includes OS interfacing and network communication code with predictable timing behavior that can be verified at design time. Experiments with multi-node targets with end-to-end timing constraints in an automotive system show that many aspects of syscode and functional code generation can be automated. To our knowledge, this is the first time that multi-node executables including communication messages, functional behaviors and para-functional properties have been automatically generated using a general platform-independent framework.","1545-3421","0-7695-2516-4","","10.1109/RTAS.2006.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613339","","Application software;Computer languages;Embedded system;Hardware;Mathematical model;Multimedia systems;Real time systems;Runtime;System testing;Timing","","","","","","14","","14","","","20060424","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these conditions strongly reduce the useful range of the measurement cell. In order to obtain a better measurement range and sensitivity high frequency must be used, but it causes a frequency-dependent decrease on the obtained viscosity values. This work introduces a new simple model in order to represent this frequency-dependent behavior. The model is based on the Maxwell model for viscoelastic materials, but using a variable parameter. This parameter has a physical meaning because it represents the linear behavior of the apparent elasticity measured along with the viscosity by ultrasound. Automotive oils SAE 90 and SAE 250 at 22.5plusmn0.5degC with viscosities at low frequency of 0.6 and 6.7 Pa.s, respectively, were tested in the range of 1-5 MHz. The model was used in order to fit the obtained data using an algorithm of non-linear regression in Matlab. By including the viscosity at low frequency as an unknown fitting parameter, it is possible to extrapolate its value. Relative deviations between the values measured by the viscometer and extrapolated using the model for the SAE 90 and SAE 250 oils were 5.0% and 15.7%, respectively.","","978-1-4244-2428-3","978-1-4244-2480-1","10.1109/ULTSYM.2008.0469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4803328","","Automotive engineering;Elasticity;Frequency measurement;Mathematical model;Oils;Rotation measurement;Testing;Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Viscosity","automotive materials;elasticity;extrapolation;lubricating oils;regression analysis;ultrasonic measurement;viscometers;viscosity measurement","Matlab;Maxwell-based model;SAE 250 oil;SAE 90 oil;apparent elasticity measurement;automotive oils;extrapolation;frequency 1 MHz to 5 MHz;frequency-dependent viscosity measurement;nonlinear regression;rotational viscometer;ultrasonic measurement;viscoelastic materials","","","","0","","","","","20090321","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The CAN bus is considerably affected by the conducted electromagnetic interference, which is generated from many disturbances such as load dumb and ignition system noise. The EMI reduces the bus efficiency by introducing bit errors in the data frame. In this paper, the effect of the conducted EMI in automotives is comprehensively studied. Reed-Solomon encoding technique is proposed to combat the burst bit errors encountered in CAN. This solution is evaluated for different burst error lengths within the MATLAB environment, where the standard of 64-bit user message is used. Moreover, the influence of the position of the burst errors is explored. The obtained results showed considerable enhancement in the CAN bus performance when the RS code was integrated beside the automatic repeat request, which has been implemented within the CAN protocol. Implementing RS-20/CRC in the CAN bus system has corrected all the corrupted frames when burst errors occurred, specifically in the data block for burst lengths shorter than 11 bits. For the burst lengths greater than 11 bits, the RS-20/CRC scheme required up to 19% frame retransmissions. When implementing RS-40/CRC, all the frames were received correctly, i.e., 0% frame retransmissions were required by the CAN bus.","","978-1-4673-6231-3","","10.1109/ICCEEE.2013.6633992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6633992","Bit Error Rate;Burst Noise;CAN Bus;EMI;Reed-Solomon Codes","Automatic repeat request;Automotive engineering;Electromagnetic interference;Error analysis;Noise;Reed-Solomon codes;Standards","Reed-Solomon codes;automotive electronics;controller area networks;electromagnetic interference;encoding;error statistics;field buses;protocols;road vehicles","CAN bus performance;CAN bus system;CAN protocol;EMI conduction;MATLAB environment;RS code;RS-20/CRC scheme;Reed-Solomon codes;automatic repeat request;automotive network;burst bit errors;burst error length;burst length;bus efficiency reduction;controller area network protocol;data block;data frame;electromagnetic interference;frame retransmission;ignition system noise;industrial network;load dumb;performance enhancement;reed-Solomon encoding technique;shared serial bus communication;user message;word length 64 bit","","","","0","","","","","20131017","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents 11-level cascaded converter as an application for high-power and/or high-voltage hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The cascade inverter is a natural fit for large automotive all-electric drives because it uses several levels of dc voltage sources, which would be available from batteries or fuel cells. In the work presented here, it is shown how the switching times (angles) in a multilevel inverter can be chosen to achieve a required fundamental voltage and not generate or weaken the specific higher order harmonics. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique is applied to multilevel inverter to determine optimum switching angles for cascaded multilevel inverters for minimizing some predominant lower order harmonics via a cost function while maintaining the required fundamental voltage. This technique can be applied to multilevel inverters with any number of levels. By a Matlab program, the optimum switching angles are calculated offline to weaken the 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th </sup> harmonics to less than 0.5%.

The critical issue of such systems can be too high urea temperature at the injector outlet. Engine compartment around the injector influences very much the injector temperature. This temperature can be estimated with a model based on interpolation maps and correlation factors. Parameters of the model can be evaluated using genetic algorithms. Main issue of this work was researching for best identification method of the parameters of the engine compartment. First, easy genetic algorithms has been designed and coupled to the temperature model, than two experiment have been defined to check various method, where changing of settings of genetic algorithms and then several runs have been performed. To evaluate which setting are most suitable, spread of the found parameters have been compared. In first two experiment absolute values of the parameters have not been exposed, third experiment has been introduced to validate short the chosen method. Output of this experiment are time course of the temperature throughout the whole simulation duration, population fitness and found parameters.

In view of this flaw, this paper presents a structurized procedure to develop the simulation platform of the two devices. Firstly, the physical and mathematical models of the two devices were established. The heat transfer situation was simulated to exclude unreasonable model. Secondly, the finite element analysis of the two devices was carried on using FLUENT. The simulated model was constantly modified by comparing the results with that of the mathematical model. In this study, FLUENT numerical analysis about the heat transfer and flow characteristics was taken on the model under four conditions. The conclusion obtained from that had great significance for the design. Finally, simulation system of the two devices was developed by the tool of MATLAB programming language and GUI design module. This simulation system can replace actual experiments by the way of analog computation. It can not only simulate performance of the system on different initial conditions to provide a decision-making basis for the optimal design of condenser and evaporator, but also shorten design cycles.","","978-1-4577-0320-1","","10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6067918","FLUENT;condenser;model;simulation platform","Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Heating;Integrated circuit modeling;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Numerical models","air conditioning;automotive electronics;decision making;finite element analysis;graphical user interfaces;heat transfer;programming languages","FLUENT numerical analysis;GUI design module;MATLAB programming language;automotive air conditioning devices;condenser;decision-making basis;evaporator;finite element analysis;flow characteristics;heat transfer;optimal design","","","","0","","5","","","20111103","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also libraries of power inverters have been created with varying topologies including the correspondent control blocks. For online simulations dSPACE Prototyping hardware is used. As power converter a new highly modular inverter has been developed covering a broad range of EC drive applications. The rapid prototyping process has successfully been evaluated in practice.

It is a low frequency and self-excited vibration that is often generated before and after the wiper reverses direction. This leads to poor visibility and an annoying sound to the driver and passengers. This paper intends to propose a control technique that is capable of reducing chatter noise and vibration in the automotive windshield wiper system. In doing so, an existing two-dimensional mathematical model of a wiper system is adopted. MATLAB Simulink is then used to simulate vibration response of the wiper. The simulated results are then verified by those obtained in the experiment. With the verified model, a control strategy, namely, input shaping is introduced. It is found that input shaping technique can reduce vibration level by approximately 30 percents over the model without control scheme.","","978-1-4244-2327-9","978-1-4244-2328-6","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4631929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631929","","Acoustic noise;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Low-frequency noise;Mathematical model;Noise generators;Noise reduction;Noise shaping;Shape control;Vibration control","","","","","","0","","12","","","20080926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effects of this change on development processes, methods, and tools as well as on required engineering skills were very significant and are still ongoing today. At present there is a new trend in the automotive industry towards model-based development. Software components are no longer handwritten in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulinktrade, Statemate, or similar tools. However, quality assurance of model-based developments, especially testing, is still poorly supported. Many development projects require creation of expensive proprietary testing solutions. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of automotive model-based development processes, the consequences for test development and the need to reconsider testing procedures in practice. Furthermore, we introduce the test tool ""TPT"" which masters the complexity of model-based testing in the automotive domain. To illustrate this statement we present a small automotive case study. TPT is based on graphical test models that are not only easy to understand but also powerful enough to express very complex, fully automated closed loop tests in real-time.

This seemingly mundane area involves meeting market and legislative requirements, which means creating a control system that combines the input from several sensors and follows complex behavioral rules (Prabhu and Mosterman, 2004). Traditional design methodologies involve writing a text specification and implementing algorithms in C. However, algorithms cannot be verified without hardware. This approach leaves the engineer in the unenviable position of waiting for the last piece of hardware to arrive to enable them to test their system. To avoid these problems, engineers need to decouple algorithm development and verification from the availability of hardware. To address this need, OEMs and suppliers around the world are switching to model-based design","","3-9810801-1-4","","10.1109/DATE.2006.243988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656852","","Automotive engineering;Consumer electronics;Control systems;Design methodology;Hardware;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Sensor systems;System testing;Writing","automotive electronics;electronic design automation","MATLAB;Simulink;automotive systems design;body electronics;hardware-software codesign;model-based design;power windows design;text specification","","","","1","","3","","","20060724","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To get these parameters are the hardest task, by these reasons we can use SimMechanics to obtain more easily these parameters, where the mechanical systems are represented by connected block diagrams. So, each block represents physical components with geometric and kinematic relationships.

The battery temperature variation affects the remaining energy capacity, which in addition influences the remaining driving range of EV. An accurate range estimation method must take battery temperature rise into account, since the charge and discharge process leads to internal heat generation. In order to determine the battery temperature rise, we built a three-dimensional electrochemical-thermal model for a prismatic lithium-iron-phosphate/graphite cell, and calibrated its heat-transferring parameters. The accuracy of the 3-D model was verified by a series of discharge experiment, with the estimation error less than 1°C. Then a driving range estimation model was design for this battery on a pure electric vehicle. When considering or not-considering the battery temperature increase, a significant driving range estimation difference was found in Matlab/Simulink simulation, showing the importance of battery temperature prediction.","","","","10.1109/VPPC.2013.6671721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671721","","","battery powered vehicles;calibration;estimation theory;graphite;heat transfer;iron compounds;lithium compounds;secondary cells","EV driving range estimation method;LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-C;Matlab-Simulink simulation;battery temperature variation;calibration;electric vehicle;heat-transferring parameter;internal heat generation;lithium-ion battery;prismatic lithium-iron-phosphate-graphite cell;series of discharge experiment;three-dimensional electrochemical-thermal model","","","","0","","","","","20131121","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces a practical solution for automotive electronic throttle control (ETC) based on Xilinx-FPGA, in which analyses the characteristic of the throttle valve, develops the system process model and researches the control strategy. A kind of dual control algorithm is proposed in the paper. That means in the large-signal control mode as start-up period of throttle valve from zero, the entire system is regarded as linear and the response is determined by the PID controller; while in the small-signal control mode during running time, the nonlinear friction and spring force compensator and air disturbance has the dominant influence on the control system behavior. Then it substitutes the original control models on Matlab/Simulink platform combined with the models from Xilinx Blockset library, and simulates the system simultaneously by software and co-hardware to verify the design.

It allows checking the observability property in a real time electronic system in order to improve its diagnosis capacity.To reach this objective, we have set up an iterative modeling process. The model of the real time electronic system represents the input for the simulation step, which precedes the property checking. It is possible to model the system in two different ways: either with a combined architectural and functional modeling using SystemC, or solely functional modeling using Matlab/Simulink. Then, we check the observability property of the system, if it is not verified, our contribution consists in adding a feedback to the modeling step to improve the model.

As a result, no phase-locked loop (PLL) is needed. Moreover, a third operation mode, i.e. the droop control mode (or the D-mode in short), is introduced to the operation of STATCOM, in addition to the conventional voltage regulation mode (or the V -mode in short) and the direct Q control mode (or the Q-mode in short).

Moreover, it is sufficient to identify only four models corresponding to four different values of desired EGR (%) and assume interpolation for transfer function coefficients to characterize the system dynamics. Since the value of the reference signal is available in real time the controller design can be reduced to four controllers corresponding to four identified models and interpolation for coefficients of the controller transfer function in cases when the value of desired EGR (%) is between the assumed values.

An essential reduction of the fuel consumption and the exhaust emissions can be realised by drive train optimisations of the auxiliaries. For the investigation of the energy consumption of conventional and innovative auxiliaries an entire vehicle simulation was developed and implemented. MatLab/Simulink was used as the simulation tool. In the simulation model the energy flows in entire motor vehicle were determined and innovative concepts of the auxiliaries were investigated. A variable drive train of each auxiliary and an uncoupling of each auxiliary from the internal combustion engine were implemented. With this setup the lowest fuel consumption of the motor vehicle can be achieved. Especially the effects of the driver and the driving cycle on the fuel consumption of the entire motor vehicle were observed. An entire vehicle simulation is developed to calculate the efficiency of the conventional motor vehicle with conventionally and innovative operated auxiliaries. Three different types of real driving cycles were measured to validate the vehicle simulation model. A comparison of the simulation and measurement results will be presented.

Previous studies have shown that in addition to parameters influencing Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), control strategies of PHEV are also influenced by the trip distance. This additional parameter makes it even more difficult to tune the parameters that minimize fuel consumption manually.

The energy from landing aircraft can be changed to electrical energy by using several power electronics converters combine with the linear generator. To have this effect the controllers must able to control the mechanical and electrical outputs. The mechanical outputs are such as the force, speed of the linear generator while the electrical outputs are the voltage and current.

Among vector control drives, indirect rotor-flux-oriented control (IRFOC) is one of the most popular and tested options, whose main weaknesses are the dependence on motor parameters and the low-speed behaviour. Parameter values change due to several reasons, such as thermal, saturation or deep-bar effect. Saturation can be avoided by controlling the flux, and the other effects are taken into account. A thermal model that focuses on obtaining stator and rotor representative temperatures is selected. Concerning the deep-bar effect, an approximate solution to a previously developed one is presented which shows a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity. In order to obtain a better behaviour in the low speed region, a speed estimator is built so that not only the dq electrical equations are considered, but also the mechanical one. It allows considering the static friction that is not properly monitored by the current measurements when their peak value is low. The proposed design includes motor overcurrent protection and its validity and usefulness is experimentally tested on a TMS320C31 DSP from the Simulink/Matlab environment.","","0-7803-8304-4","","10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1571847","Vector control;deepbar effect;parameter estimation","Aerospace control;Aerospace testing;Automotive engineering;Induction motors;Machine vector control;Mathematical model;Parameter estimation;Rotors;Sensorless control;Stators","control engineering computing;electric machine analysis computing;induction motor drives;machine vector control;motor protection;overcurrent protection;parameter estimation;rotors;stators","Simulink-Matlab environment;TMS320C31 DSP;deep-bar effect;deep-bar effects;indirect rotor-flux-oriented control;induction motor;motor overcurrent protection;online parameter estimation;position sensors;sensorless drive control;static friction;thermal effects;vector control drives","","","","0","","10","","","20060110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hematologists distinguish metamyelocytes by their characteristic kidney shape of its nucleus. A novel approach for metamyelocyte classification uses a set of morphological templates. By transforming a pixel based contour to a contour region, morphological templates, the classification becomes a matter of sequence searching on a symbolic string.

The model features three main subsystems that make up the TEG system; these are the heat exchanger, the thermoelectric material and the power conditioning unit. Particular attention has been given to the power conditioning unit where two different DC-DC converter topologies namely; buck-boost and single ended primary inductor capacitor (SEPIC) have been compared for best performance. In addition, the Perturb and Observe maximum power point tracking algorithm has also been implemented and compared with a standard fixed duty cycle pulse width modulator (PWM) control. The process of developing the subsystems are briefly explained and the advantages of using the maximum power point system is demonstrated.

The analysis of the transmission of a RF signal through a wireless channel is a key point in the overall performance. Several kinds of channels models have been studied, like Gaussian, Ricean and Rayleigh, but using only one of them to evaluate the communication system is not enough; a real channel doesn't have the same characteristics all the time. Knowing the possible channels that can be present in a transmission channel and applying Markov chains, it is possible to implement a more realistic channel. This article compares four types of scenarios in suburban areas, using in all the cases Markov chains. The first scenario has two channels; the second scenario has three channels; the third one has four channels and the last one has five channels. The channels implemented in these scenarios were Gaussian, many types of Ricean and Rayleigh. A comparison between them was done. This analysis was implemented by simulations in Matlab.","","978-0-7695-2974-5","","10.1109/CERMA.2007.4367710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4367710","","AWGN channels;Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Degradation;Mathematical model;Performance analysis;Rayleigh channels;Robots;Signal analysis;Telecommunication services","AWGN channels;Markov processes;Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;error statistics;matrix algebra","AWGN channel;BER curves;Gaussian channels;Markov chains;N-states channel model;RF signal transmission;Rayleigh channels;Ricean channels;suburban areas;telecommunication services;transition matrix","","","","3","","11","","","20071029","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results are obtained with CFD calculations, namely by STARCCM+ for an axisymmetric model, taking advantage of the symmetry of the problem, to minimize the computational time; in addition the HAHT is simulated with an actuator disk that gave reliable results in good agreement with previous works, developed with different software, and with experimental results. The original airfoil was designed for high-lift regimes, so it already gave excellent performance in these kind of applications.

Thus, MATLAB/Simulink is not amenable to realizing self-adaption behavior, where the software architecture of the system evolves during runtime. In this paper, we show how to model self-adaptive software using our language Mechatronic UML and how we transform a model specified in Mechatronic UML into a MATLAB/Simulink model automatically. In particular, we generate several helper functions that emulate self-adaptive behavior in MATLAB/Simulink, relying only on standard Simulink blocks.

We used fuzzy controllers as a part of a semi-active vehicle suspension system, which consists of semi-active air spring and passive damper. System is implemented between the cabin floor and vehicle seat. Fuzzy controllers are designed to adjust the stiffness of the air spring, in order to isolate the vertical vibrations that are being caused by rough road surfaces. Each controller is tuned for different road type. Which controller is active depends on the output of the neural network, representing one of the four roads. Input data for fuzzy controller are vehicle seat deflection and velocity of the vehicle seat deflection. Measure of the quality of suspension is the SEAT value, which is calculated as a quotient of effective seat vertical acceleration and effective cabin vertical acceleration (ISO 2631-1 standard). Small SEAT-value means good isolation of the seat, regarding the vibrations.

Simulated by Matlab/Simulink, the route memorization algorithm shows the obvious advantage in the data compression, which makes the compression ratio up to 22.3. In the meantime, the calculus threshold can be constructed in a certain range, which qualifies the algorithm with a good robustness.

For large, real-world designs, however, it is not always clear, whether or not a certain context violates even the most basic design assumptions of employed library components, thus often leading to expensive runtime errors. This paper introduces a practical method for checking compatibility of large designs, statically. This method not only ensures that large component-based designs provide a context such that all (library) components have well defined types, but it also ensures that transmitted physical units, such as m2, km/h, mph, etc. are preserved during computation. As such the possibility for runtime errors is reduced, and a metric for sound component reuse given.","1089-6503","978-0-7695-2977-6","","10.1109/EUROMICRO.2007.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4301070","","Australia;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Inference algorithms;Libraries;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Measurement units;Runtime","object-oriented programming;reasoning about programs;software libraries;software reusability","component libraries;component-based system compatibility;component-based system reuse;type inference;unit inference","","","","2","","14","","","20070917","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

For these reasons, embedded systems have became more complicated and require a lot of time for designing. Model-based programming has came into the spotlight in the embedded system industry that demands short time-to-market, especially in the automotive industry. Model-based programming allows the developer to design and implement the system easily by using blocks that provide automatic code-generation function. In addition, blocks provide the simulation function at the design and implementation step. Among the model-based programming's features, simulation is of greatest importance because accurate simulation can reduce cost, time and effort. Most simulators just estimate that the model works correctly without consideration of hardware characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes the new hybrid-block that can simulate not only functions of the model, but also features of hardware. We develop the 16-bit embedded system for the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in the automotive system and implement the hybrid-blocks that have two modes of automatic code-generation and simulation. The application model can be constructed by using the hybrid-block. In automatic code-generation mode, models can generate complete C program code for a specific platform without any modification. In simulation mode, the model can be simulated by considering the hardware and software characteristics of the model. In this paper, consequence of simulation with real-value in the 16-bit embedded system is compared.","","978-89-950038-6-2","978-89-950038-6-2","10.1109/ICCAS.2007.4406575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406575","Automatic code-generation;ECU;Embedded system;Model-based programming;Simulation","Application software;Automatic control;Automatic programming;Automotive engineering;Costs;Embedded system;Functional programming;Hardware;Mathematical model;Time to market","automatic programming;automobile industry;automotive electronics;digital simulation;embedded systems;program compilers","Matlab;Simulink;automatic code generation function;automotive industry;automotive system;complete C program code;electronic control unit;embedded systems;hardware characteristics;model-based programming","","","","0","","11","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The passive suspension system cannot reduce the vibrations which are transmitted from the road disturbances to the frame which affect the ride comfort and vehicle stability. The magnitude of these vibrations can be reduced by using ABFNN based an active suspension system. The ABFNN has ability to approximate the nonlinearity of the vehicle. By using B-spline membership function in the fuzzy neural network the approximation ability of the network is increased. The shape of B-spline membership function is adjusted self adaptively by changing control points during learning process. B-spline membership functions give a structure for choosing the shape of the fuzzy sets. The update parameters of ABFNN are trained by gradient-based technique that may fall into local minima during the learning process. The ABFNN is successfully applied to full car suspension model which reduces the seat, heave pitch and roll displacement of the vehicle.

In early design phases, even when there is still uncertainty about the feasibility of the requirements, valuable information can be gained from models that describe the expected usage and the desired system reaction. The generation of test cases from these models indicates the feasibility of the intended solution and helps to identify scenarios for which the realization is hardly feasible or the intended system behavior is not properly defined. In this paper we present the formalization of requirements by models to simulate the expected field usage of a system. These so called usage models can be enriched by information about the desired system reaction. Thus, they are the basis for all subsequent testing activities: First, they can be used to verify the first implementation models and design decisions w.r.t. the fulfillment of requirements and second, test cases can be derived in a random or statistic manner. The generation can be controlled with operational profiles that describe different classes of field usage. We have applied our approach at a large German car manufacturer in the early development phase of active safety functionalities. Test cases were generated from the usage models to assess the implementation models in MATLAB/Simulink. The parametrization of the systems could be optimized and a faulty transition in the implementation models was revealed.

Practically, torque ripple exist, mainly due to emf waveform imperfections, current ripple and phase current commutation. Hence, an error can occur between real value and the simulation result. First a simple mathematical model of the BLDC drive is developed. The motor model is then simulated using MATLAB/Simulink, with sinusoidal and trapezoidal waveforms of backemf.

It is possible to use an electronic differential (ED) instead of the heavy mechanical differential because of the fast response time of the motor. A new ED control approach for a two-in-wheel-motor drive EV is devised based on the fuzzy logic control method. The fuzzy logic method employs to estimate the slip rate of each wheel considering the complex and nonlinear of the system. Then, the ED system distributes torque and power to each motor according to requirements. The effectiveness and validation of the proposed control method are evaluated in the Matlab/Simulink environment.

The control strategy used is a look-down reference system which uses a sensor at the front bumper to measure the lateral displacement and a GPS to measure the heading orientation. Firstly, the road curvature estimator is designed based on the steering angle. Secondly, the steering angles can be estimated by using the sensor and the GPS information. The estimation algorithm employed is an observer for a new extended system model, in which the steering angle and its derivative are viewed as two state variables. Then, the lateral displacements estimation and the control algorithm are investigated. An accurate and real-time estimation of the lateral displacements with respect to the road can be accomplished in such a control system. The closed loop controller is used as a compensator to control the lateral dynamics of the vehicle. The vehicle dynamic and control system are simulated with Matlab Simulink. The proposed estimation and control algorithms are validated by simulation results.

Our proposed multi-domain model integrates an electrical model based on typical diode equations, a dynamic thermal model composed of a Cauer type RC network driven by currnet source, and an optical model derived from the forward current and junction temperature variations of the total luminous flux. The presented approach offers three significant advantages over the traditional single-domain modeling: the effects of packaging and board level thermal management can be evaluated in correlation with electrical parameters, the self heating effect of the junction can be analyzed in the time domain, and the variation of luminous flux output can be observed. The model is defined based on SPICE circuit elements and can be used with any conventional SPICE circuit solver, without the need for solver algorithm modification.

The model includes a direct rotor flux oriented controlled (DFOC) induction machine drive, which is operated in both motoring and generating modes (i.e. starter and alternator modes). During the starting, the induction machine cranks the engine with high starting torque against the engine restoring torque. When the speed of the engine is increased to a certain value that ensures the complete starting of the engine, the control system changes the induction machine into the generation mode. In the generation mode, the power is input to the machine from the automotive engine which is modeled as an infinite source of torque. The DC bus voltage is maintained at 42 V. The operating speed of the modeled ISA can be varied, with field weakening starting at the machine base speed. The model successfully allows many operational aspects of the proposed ISA to be predicted, in particular the regulated DC voltage developed by the ISA during conditions of load dump step speed increase.","","7-5605-1869-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377000","","","alternators;asynchronous generators;automobiles;electric drives;electric machine analysis computing;machine vector control;mathematics computing;rotors;starting;torque","42 V;DC bus voltage regulation;Matlab-Simulink model;automobiles;automotive engine;automotive engine speed;direct rotor flux oriented control;dynamic model;engine restoring torque;induction generator;induction machine cranks;induction machine drive;integrated starter alternator","","","","1","","","","","20050502","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, the moving vehicles that are needed to be tracked are often overlapped in the image. As a result, the mistakes in the targets segment and traffic parameters calculation are the problems much more difficult to solve. Generally, the moving target occlusion in video can be divided into two categories, one is the occlusion between the targets, the other one is the occlusion between the target and background. Considering the occlusion between the targets, a vehicles segmentation algorithm, which is based on feature points on contour, is presented in this paper. First of all, it is needed to detect and judge that if the occlusion between the targets was exist in the moving region according to the calculation of the duty cycle and the ratio of length and width. Then, the connective vehicles region that involving vehicle occlusion will be segmented into independent targets according segmentation algorithm mentioned above. MATLAB is used as the simulation platform to implement the functions of the vehicles segmentation. Experiment results show that the algorithm presented in this paper is effective and feasible, and also have good application prospects.","","978-1-4244-4690-2","978-1-4244-4692-6","10.1109/FBIE.2009.5405798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5405798","detection of the moving vehicles;feature points on contour;segmentation of the overlapped vehicles","Automotive engineering;Biomedical engineering;Histograms;Image segmentation;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Object detection;Railway engineering;Target tracking;Vehicle detection","hidden feature removal;image motion analysis;image segmentation;traffic engineering computing;video signal processing","MATLAB;contour feature points;monitoring video;moving target occlusion;moving vehicles detection;moving vehicles identification;moving vehicles tracking;overlapped vehicle segmentation;traffic parameters calculation","","","","1","","6","","","20100205","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the development process for these has by and large remained a manual, document led process. This inevitably leads to delays, interpretation errors and omissions which are often not identified until late in the process - when it is time consuming and expensive to change the design. Furthermore, the design has to be verified and validated from requirements through to the final implementation. Manual processes make this a laborious and thankless task. By utilising the powerful and flexible model based design process allowed by MATLABreg & Simulinkreg, this paper will show how complex and innovative new working methods can be developed to improve the design cycle. These will allow rapid modeling and testing of algorithms, before committing to the expense of development for the final hardware platform, and the resulting cost benefits achieved by avoiding late changes to the design.

Control strategies of the EMS primarily aim at maximizing driving range and power of the vehicle with simultaneous consideration of physical degradation of the energy source due to the utilization. Previous papers consider hybrid energy storage systems consisting of batteries and Ultra Capacitors [1] or batteries and Fuel Cells [2]. These systems are designed to gain best performance out of a high energy density source combined with a more powerful peak power device. Within the project 'e performance' supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) an electric vehicle powered by two lithium-ion battery packs of different capacity and voltage has been developed to make optimum use of available space in the car taking into account crash safety. Although using the same cell type in each battery pack, this topology results in a complex system with several components which must be managed via a data communication system (CAN bus). The EMS in this system controls the current flows of both packs independently by means of two DC-DC converters. The EMS acts as an intermediary between energy storage (battery management systems - BMS) and the drivetrain controller on the vehicle control unit (VCU). Main objective of the EMS is to provide all the propulsion power the driver requests and simultaneously minimize uneven battery degeneration. The usage of two DC-DC converters, two battery management systems and an on-board charger required the development of a new energy management system which interacts with the VCU. This paper describes the most important functions of the EMS and its interfaces to the BMS and the VCU. To validate the algorithms before integrating them into the first vehicle prototype, a detailed ""Matlab/Simulink""-model has been created. The EMS presented in this paper is made to operate in - real-world sports car and fulfills therefore all automotive requirements including communication to all other relevant elements of the vehicle. However, this paper presents results from the simulations, because the car is scheduled to drive on the road from mid of September 2012 onwards. During the conference, data from the measurement in the vehicle will be presented additionally.","","978-1-4673-0953-0","","10.1109/VPPC.2012.6422664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422664","","Energy management;MATLAB;Topology;Vehicles","DC-DC power convertors;battery powered vehicles;energy management systems;supercapacitors","DC-DC converters;data communication system;electric consumers;electric vehicle;energy management system;hybrid energy storage systems;multisource storage system;physical degradation;power sources;ultracapacitors;uneven battery degeneration;vehicular applications control","","","","0","","10","","","20130131","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is one of the computer-based solution methods which are more widely employed in aerospace engineering. The computational power and time required to carry out the analysis increases as the fidelity of the analysis increases. Aerodynamic shape optimization has become a vital part of aircraft design in the recent years. Generally if we want to optimize an airfoil we have to describe the airfoil and for that, we need to have at least hundred points of x and y co-ordinates. It is really difficult to optimize airfoils with this large number of co-ordinates. Nowadays many different schemes of parameter sets are used to describe general airfoil such as B-spline, Hicks-Henne Bump function, PARSEC etc. The main goal of these parameterization schemes is to reduce the number of needed parameters as few as possible while controlling the important aerodynamic features effectively. Here the work has been done on the PARSEC geometry representation method. The objective of this work is to introduce the knowledge of describing general airfoil using twelve parameters by representing its shape as a polynomial function. And also we have introduced the concept of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simplex-Simulated Annealing (SIMPSA) and Genetic Algorithm to optimize the aerodynamic characteristics of a general airfoil for specific conditions. A MATLAB program has been developed to implement PARSEC, Panel Technique, Genetic Algorithm, SIMPSA and PSO. This program has been tested for a standard NACA 2411 airfoil and optimized to improve its coefficient of lift. Pressure distribution and co-efficient of lift for airfoil geometries has been calculated using panel method. NACA 2411 airfoil has been generated using PARSEC and optimized for 5.0 deg angle of attack using PSO, Genetic Algorithm and SIMPSA.","","978-1-4673-0270-8","","10.1109/ICCCA.2012.6179183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179183","Aerodynamic Shape Optimization;Genetic Algorithm;PSO;Parametric Section;SIMPSA","Aerodynamics;Algorithm design and analysis;Automotive components;Genetic algorithms;Geometry;Optimization;Shape","aerodynamics;aerospace components;aircraft;computational fluid dynamics;design engineering;genetic algorithms;mechanical engineering computing;particle swarm optimisation;polynomials;shapes (structures);splines (mathematics)","B-splines;CFD method;Hicks-Henne Bump function;MATLAB program;PARSEC geometry representation method;PSO method;SIMPSA;aerodynamic features;aerodynamic shape optimization;aerospace engineering;aircraft design;computational fluid dynamics;computer-based solution methods;genetic algorithm;panel method;panel technique;parameterization schemes;particle swarm optimization;polynomial function;pressure distribution;simplex simulated annealing;standard NACA 2411 airfoil","","","","0","","11","","","20120405","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the efficient development of reliable control software is difficult. We have proposed to introduce a “model-based design” process using MATLAB/Simulink, established in the automotive and aerospace fields, to the development of power electronics systems. However, it was difficult in the past because calculating switching circuit as the plant model is difficult in MATLAB/Simulink due to the socalled stiff equation problem. Thus, in this study, we have developed a simulation environment in which the standard model-based design tool, MATLAB/Simulink, and the simulation engine for power switching circuits, SCALE, work cooperatively. SCALE was originally developed to solve stiff equation and efficiently simulate power switching circuits. This software environment enables us to design control algorithms with intuitive block diagram expression and test them in actual hardware, without writing a C program. Furthermore to improve this environment, a mechanism that handles the multiple sample rates was introduced. Smart energy systems that use several controllers with different sampling rates can be simulated in the proposed environment. Thus, we can develop control software for smart energy systems in a timely and cost effective manner.","","978-1-4673-2328-4","978-1-4673-2329-1","10.1109/ICRERA.2012.6477477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477477","control;model-based design;simulation;software","Batteries;Computational modeling;Control systems;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Software packages","C language;control engineering computing;power electronics;power engineering computing;smart power grids;switching circuits;switching convertors","C program;Matlab-Simulink;SCALE;aerospace fields;automotive fields;block diagram expression;complex control software;control algorithms design;multisample-rate controllers;power converters;power electronics systems;power switching circuits;reliable control software;sampling rates;simulation environment;smart energy applications;standard model-based design tool;stiff equation problem","","","","0","","7","","","20130314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Legislation that will be applied to diesel engines during the period 2010-2020 continue to put great emphasis on both nitrogen oxides NO<sub>x</sub> and particulate matter (PM). With the increasing effort to reduce emissions and maintain fuel economy manufacturers are focussing on engine control. Engine control requires data acquisition and acquisition requires sensors, but hardware in the form of sensors adds further cost to the production. As a result, so called virtual sensors are introduced. These are estimators that predict the required data, which is costly to measure or simply incapable of measurement. In this paper a parallel neural network structure is built. It consists of three non-linear autoregressive exogenous input (NLARX) neural network models used to predict the smoke emissions of a diesel engine operated in a non-road-transient cycle. Existing resources from Matlab toolboxes are used in order to monitor both the cost and computational expenses of analysis. The data is re-ordered into training and validation sets and processed. To overcome the weakness of the neural network approach in respect of high frequency signals, the data is divided into layers to split up the frequencies and cut high amplitudes. Three horizontal layers of the signal are processed in parallel through independent NLARX-models and their performances are added to give an overall result.","0743-1619","978-1-4244-4523-3","978-1-4244-4524-0","10.1109/ACC.2009.5160119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5160119","Diesel Engine;Emission;Modelling;NLARX;Neural Networks;Smoke","Costs;Data acquisition;Diesel engines;Frequency conversion;Fuel economy;Hardware;Legislation;Manufacturing;Neural networks;Nitrogen","air pollution;data acquisition;diesel engines;environmental science computing;neural nets","Matlab toolboxes;computational expenses;data acquisition;diesel engine emissions prediction;emission legislation;engine control;engine management functions;fuel economy;nitrogen oxides;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous input neural network models;nonroad-transient cycle;parallel neural networks;particulate matter;smoke emissions;virtual sensors","","","","2","","17","","","20090710","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The root causes of the faults include hardware components such as actuators, software within the controllers (ECUs), or the interactions between hardware and software, i.e., between controllers and plants. These faults, originating from various interactions and especially between hardware and software, are particularly challenging to address. Our basic strategy is to divide the fault universe of the cyber-physical system in a hierarchical manner, and monitor the critical variables/signals that have impact at different levels of interactions. Diagnostic matrix is established to represent the relationship between the faults and the test outcomes (also known as fault signatures). A factorial hidden Markov model-based inference algorithm, termed dynamic multiple fault diagnosis, is used to infer the root causes based on the observed test outcomes. The proposed diagnostic strategy is validated on an electrical power generation and storage system controlled by two ECUs in an environment with CANoe/MATLAB co-simulation. Eleven faults are injected with the failures originating in actuator hardware, sensor, controller hardware, and software components (sensor faults are not considered in this paper). The simulation results show that the proposed diagnostic strategy is effective in addressing the interaction-caused faults.","1083-4435","","","10.1109/TMECH.2012.2214397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6302201","Automotive systems;CANoe;cyber-physical systems;dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD);electrical power generation and storage system (EPGS);electronic control units (ECUs);fault diagnosis;fault modeling;hierarchical tests;sympathetic faults;test design","Automotive engineering;Energy storage;Fault diagnosis;Hierarchical systems;Power generation","automotive electrics;electric power generation;energy storage;fault diagnosis;hidden Markov models","CANoe-Matlab co-simulation;ECUs;EPGS;actuators;automotive control system;automotive electric power generation and storage system;controller hardware;cyber-physical system;diagnostic matrix;dynamic multiple fault diagnosis;electronic control units;factorial hidden Markov model-based inference algorithm;fault detection technique;fault isolation techniques;software components;vehicle systems","","","","1","","26","","2012-09-13","20131211","","IEEE","ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is very important to study and improve the braking ability of the automobile. The anti-lock braking system (ABS) is the active method of increasing the braking ability. The ABS controller is the key to ABS. The modeling and simulation of the automobile braking system can be used in designing the ABS controller. The general braking model is built by analyzing the forces on the automobile body and it is difficult to be understood. A new method which establishes the braking model is presented in this paper. When the automobile is braking, the kinetic is worn down by frictions that come from the wheels and road, the wheels and the braking block. A single wheel mathematical model is deduced with this principle. The simulation models of this braking system and ABS are established. Simulations under Matlab/ Simulink are made. The braking distances obtained by the simulation are compared with the known data. The results show that the braking model based on the kinetic energy conversion is reliable. This method can provide a new way to analyze the automobile braking process.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677741","Anti-lock braking system;Braking model;Kinetic energy","Automobiles;Friction;Kinetic energy;Kinetic theory;Mathematical model;Propulsion;Road accidents;Security;Vehicles;Wheels","automobiles;automotive engineering;brakes;braking;friction;road accidents;road traffic;vehicle dynamics;velocity control;wheels","ABS controller design;Matlab-simulink;antilock braking system;automobile braking system;fatal traffic accident;force analysis;frictions;kinetic energy conversion;overlength braking distance;road vehicles;single wheel mathematical model","","","","0","","6","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These contradicting requirements have brought about the development of hydrobushings. The operational principle of hydrobushings was introduced simply. Meanwhile, two most important dynamic characteristic parameters were illustrated. The novel and innovative model of hydrobushing was built in multi-disciplinary simulation software AMESim (Advanced Modeling and Simulation Environment for systems Engineering). The mathematical software MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) was used to process the simulation results of model in software AMESim. The dynamic characteristic tests were performed with MTS 831 servo-controlled hydraulic test rig. And experimental data are conformable to the simulation results. Therefore, it proves that virtual prototype model is correct and believable. Finally, this innovative model was used to research how the structural and related parameters have an effect on the dynamic behavior of hydrobushings.","","978-1-4244-9699-0","","10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982461","AMESim;MATLAB;dynamic behavior;hydrobushing;simulation","Data models;Harmonic analysis;Insulators;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Vehicle dynamics","bushings;digital simulation;hydraulic systems;innovation management;mathematics computing;mechanical engineering computing;vibration control;virtual prototyping","AMESim multidisciplinary simulation software;Advanced Modeling and Simulation Environment for Systems Engineering;MTS 831 servocontrol hydraulic test rig;Matlab;Matrix Laboratory;hydrobushings dynamic behavior;innovative method;shake control;structural parameters;structure borne noise isolation;virtual prototype model","","","","0","","5","","","20110811","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
