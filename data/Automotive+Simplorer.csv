VTC 2003-Fall. 2003 IEEE 58th","6-9 Oct. 2003","2003","5","","3262","3266 Vol.5","The increasing complexity of electrical and electromechanical systems in vehicles has prompted significant new developments in the automotive industry. The design of these systems requires reliable simulation tools with comprehensive component libraries capable of dealing with complex, multi-domain systems. In addition, these systems should be able to integrate with the various stages of the design processes and support easy information exchange between suppliers and OEMs. This paper outlines the use of Ansoft's SIMPLORER design environment for automotive applications, with a focus on SIMPLORER's automotive component library and its usage cases. The automotive library contains a comprehensive list of electrical and mechanical component models that are typically used in on-board vehicle systems. These components range from fuses, lamps, wires, electrical machines and relays to electrochemical elements like fuel cells and batteries. Due to its open simulator coupling technology, the SIMPLORER simulation environment seamlessly integrates with existing design flows and other design tools like Simulink and ADVISOR. SIMPLORER's compliance with the IEEE standardized modeling language VHDL-AMS encourages new possibilities of model exchange between OEM and suppliers.","1090-3038","0-7803-7954-3","","10.1109/VETECF.2003.1286257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286257","","Automotive applications;Automotive components;Automotive engineering;Electromechanical systems;Fuses;Lamps;Libraries;Process design;Vehicles;Wires","CAD;IEEE standards;automobile industry;automotive electronics;hardware description languages;mechanical engineering computing;production engineering computing;software libraries","ADVISOR;Ansoft;IEEE standardized modeling language;SIMPLORER design environment;Simulink;VHDL-AMS standardized modeling language;automotive component library;automotive electrical system design;automotive industry;electrical component model;electrochemical element;mechanical component model;on-board vehicle system;open simulator coupling technology","","","","2","","","","","20040504","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Optimal design of a synchronous DC-DC converter using analytical models and a dedicated optimization tool","Larouci, C.; Didier, J. P.; Aldebert, A.; Bouquet, O.; Prost, A.; Vauchel, J.","Lab. Commande et Syst., Ecole Superieure des Tech. Aeronaut. et de Constr. Automobile, France","Industrial Electronics Society, 2003. IECON '03. The 29th Annual Conference of the IEEE","2-6 Nov. 2003","2003","2","","1623","1628 Vol.2","The aim of this paper is to present an optimization approach of static converters using analytical models and a dedicated tool. Indeed, tools like Saber, Pspice or Simplorer are effective means for the power electronics structure time-domain studies. However, if these structures have an ac input and a high switching frequency (various time scales), or if several aspect studies are taken into account, time-domain simulation becomes painful and expensive in memory and computing time. The study of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) performances is also difficult because of the line impedance stabilizer network (LISN) time-constants which come to penalize the time-domain simulation. In addition, in sizing and optimization process, results in short computing times are needed, so the time-domain simulation may be too time consuming. In this way, the paper proposes to carry out a compromise between the model accuracy and the tool rapidness and recommends the use of analytical models to optimize the passive element volume of static converters by respecting EMC standards, by minimizing the whole dissipated losses (conduction and switching semiconductor losses, core and copper inductor losses, capacitor losses) and by constraining the semiconductor junction, the winding and the magnetic circuit temperatures. This optimization approach is applied to a 42 V-14 V dc-dc converter for the automotive domain (output power 1 kW). The developed optimization procedure is validated by numerical simulation and measures.","","0-7803-7906-3","","10.1109/IECON.2003.1280301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280301","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Constraint optimization;DC-DC power converters;Design optimization;Electromagnetic compatibility;Impedance;Power electronics;Switching frequency;Time domain analysis","DC-DC power convertors;SPICE;electromagnetic compatibility;losses;optimisation;time-domain analysis","42 to 14 V;dedicated optimization tool;electromagnetic compatibility performances;line impedance stabilizer network;power electronics structure;static converters;synchronous DC-DC converter;time-constants;time-domain simulation","","","","3","","18","","","20040405","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Multi-Domain System Level Behavioral HEV Library Using VHDL-AMS","Xiao Li; Kher, S.; Shaohua Lin","ANSYS Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Electric Vehicle Conference (IEVC), 2013 IEEE International","23-25 Oct. 2013","2013","","","1","5","The past decade has seen an increase in demand for electrical and hybrid electrical vehicles, leading to an increased need for multi-domain modeling and simulation techniques. VHDL-AMS is an industry standard multi-domain behavioral description language with the ability to present analog, digital and mixed-signal models. The multi-domain attribute of VHDL-AMS provides a convenient way to model complex automotive systems. This paper presents a VHDL-AMS based system level behavioral HEV library developed in ANSYS Simplorer. The library is intended to provide reusable generic components for HEV system level design as well as demonstrative application examples. The library consists of dynamic mathematical models, developed to provide the ability to evaluate component behavior. The newly developed models are connected in typical vehicle configurations and simulated and behaviorally validated under standardized drive cycles.","","","","10.1109/IEVC.2013.6681149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681149","","Batteries;DC motors;Fuels;Hybrid electric vehicles;Libraries;Torque","hardware description languages;hybrid electric vehicles;libraries;mathematical analysis;power engineering computing","ANSYS Simplorer;VHDL-AMS;analog model;complex automotive system;digital model;dynamic mathematical model;hybrid electrical vehicle;industry standard multidomain behavioral description language;mixed-signal model;multidomain system level behavioral HEV library;standardized drive cycle","","","","0","","","","","20131212","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
