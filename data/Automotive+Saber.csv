This model is then applied to simulate the performance of an inverter system. Simulation results accurately match the measurement.

Indeed, tools like Saber, Pspice or Simplorer are effective means for the power electronics structure time-domain studies. However, if these structures have an ac input and a high switching frequency (various time scales), or if several aspect studies are taken into account, time-domain simulation becomes painful and expensive in memory and computing time. The study of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) performances is also difficult because of the line impedance stabilizer network (LISN) time-constants which come to penalize the time-domain simulation. In addition, in sizing and optimization process, results in short computing times are needed, so the time-domain simulation may be too time consuming. In this way, the paper proposes to carry out a compromise between the model accuracy and the tool rapidness and recommends the use of analytical models to optimize the passive element volume of static converters by respecting EMC standards, by minimizing the whole dissipated losses (conduction and switching semiconductor losses, core and copper inductor losses, capacitor losses) and by constraining the semiconductor junction, the winding and the magnetic circuit temperatures. This optimization approach is applied to a 42 V-14 V dc-dc converter for the automotive domain (output power 1 kW). The developed optimization procedure is validated by numerical simulation and measures.","","0-7803-7906-3","","10.1109/IECON.2003.1280301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280301","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Constraint optimization;DC-DC power converters;Design optimization;Electromagnetic compatibility;Impedance;Power electronics;Switching frequency;Time domain analysis","DC-DC power convertors;SPICE;electromagnetic compatibility;losses;optimisation;time-domain analysis","42 to 14 V;dedicated optimization tool;electromagnetic compatibility performances;line impedance stabilizer network;power electronics structure;static converters;synchronous DC-DC converter;time-constants;time-domain simulation","","","","3","","18","","","20040405","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The degree of imbalance was found to be affected by a number of parameters including the offset voltage (voltage drop) between modules communicating on the bus.

However, the stability analysis of the advanced automotive electrical systems which composed by multi-voltage level hybrid ac and dc systems is much complex than a single converter. In the system level, the downstream converter behaves as a constant power load (CPL) which shows negative incremental resistance and may cause negative impedance instability in the system. In addition, there is no general model for large signal stability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. In view of the above, this paper set up a reduced order large signal model for the step-down cascaded system first, and analyzes the stability of converters with CPL based on Lyapunov stability theory.

This research analyzed the root cause of the failure by analyzing the load-dump energy, using SABER modeling and simulation, which have been verified by tests. Various concept alternatives for minimizing the load-dump energy have been identified and an innovative and cost-effective solution based on fast field control was selected for development of the proof-of-concept hardware. The proposed technique reduced the load-dump transient duration by more than a factor of 5, resulting in a reduction of load-dump energy by more than 75%. This eliminated the need for paralleling multiple avalanche diodes in the alternator rectifier bridge to handle the transient energy, resulting in a smaller package and increased reliability at a lower cost.

Also libraries of power inverters have been created with varying topologies including the correspondent control blocks. For online simulations dSPACE Prototyping hardware is used. As power converter a new highly modular inverter has been developed covering a broad range of EC drive applications. The rapid prototyping process has successfully been evaluated in practice.

Even though the protocol is well understood, implementing its physical layer is becoming more and more challenging. Vehicle manufacturers have decided to replace current low speed CAN implementations with high speed CAN solutions. This is a requirement of the increasing bus load. The number of electronic control units increases for individual CAN high speed sub-networks which makes it more challenging to ensure a robust implementation of the targeted network topology. A manual verification of the In-Vehicle network's signal integrity in the early stage of development, where no hardware prototypes are available, is not possible due to its high transient behavior. The only choice to verify prototype topologies is through a model based design flow. A virtual In-Vehicle network implementation allows the early verification of physical layer robustness before any hardware prototypes are built-up. This allows the network developer to discover any possible issues very early and to fix them without changing any hardware implementations. This paper gives an overview of the challenges network developers face when dealing with the physical layer implementation. In addition it shows how to develop a robust implementation through a model based design method, taking into account environmental variations and component tolerances to ensure the system works even under worst case conditions.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-815-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383635","CAN;signal integrity;vehicle topology","","","","","","","0","","","","","20071119","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"
