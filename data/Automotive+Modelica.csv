These systems are among the most complex cyber physical systems being designed by humans. However, automotive cyber physical systems are not a loose combination of cyber system and physical system, but are a tight and comprehensive integration, and they are ubiquitous spatial-temporal and very large-scale complex systems. In automotive cyber physical systems, the behavior of the physical world such as the velocity, flow and density are dynamic and continuous changing with time while the process of communication and calculation in vehicular cyber system is discrete. In this paper, we extend the AADL to model the cyber world and physical world of automotive cyber physical system, and we propose a method to transform the rule of Cellular Automata to AADL model for modeling spatial-temporal requirements. We also propose an approach to transform the Modelica model to AADL model. The proposed method is illustrated by Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET).","","","","10.1109/DCABES.2013.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636422","AADL;CPS;Continuous Dynamic Features;Spatial-Temporal;VANET","Analytical models;Automata;Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Object oriented modeling;Vehicles","automotive engineering;cellular automata;mechanical engineering computing;programming languages;software architecture;ubiquitous computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","AADL model;CPS;Modelica model;VANET;architecture analysis-and-design language;architecture description language;automotive cyber physical system modeling;cellular automata;communication networks;physical devices;software controllers;ubiquitous spatial-temporal systems;vehicular ad-hoc network;vehicular cyber system;very large-scale complex systems","","","","0","","","","","20131021","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","3-5 Sept. 2008","2008","","","1","5","Ever increasing oil prizes as well as climatic issues and constantly rising development costs force the automotive industry to adapt their automotive concepts and design processes to meet these strict requirements. Vehicle simulations can contribute to these issues and support the car manufacturer. Simulating new concepts in advance reduces the need of building expensive prototypes instead. Building hybrid electric or even electric vehicles instead of conventional fuel driven vehicles will be the future goal because of steadily rising requirements like exhaust emission standards. In this contribution, a series hybrid electric vehicle simulation with the simulation language Modelica will be developed. Modelica will be desribed and the simulation approach will be explained. Some simulation results will conclude this contribution.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677762","Forward and Backward Simulation;Modelica;Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle;Simulation","Automotive engineering;Buildings;Costs;Energy management;Fuel processing industries;Hybrid electric vehicles;Manufacturing industries;Petroleum;Process design;Virtual manufacturing","energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles","automotive industry;car manufacturer;energy management strategies;series hybrid electric vehicle;simulation language Modelica;vehicle simulations","","","","2","","8","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The language has been designed to allow tools to generate efficient code automatically. Approaches supported by the Dynamic Modeling Laboratory Dymola from Dynasim are presented. Real-time simulation of an automatic gearbox is discussed to demonstrate the power of symbolic manipulation. A gearbox is inherently hybrid, since the structure varies during each gearshift. Friction is also an important phenomenon. It takes Dymola only a few seconds to translate a Modelica model of an automatic gearbox with 11 switching elements into efficient simulation code.

A simulation of a vehicle concept with both models will be described and investigated by means of an advanced simulation tool - the SmartElectricDrives (SED) Library - and a Modelica/Dymola simulation environment. The SED library provides the most important electric drive types including controlled electric machines which are described by algebraic and differential equations. Due to this kind of modelling, the machines provide higher flexibility in case of parameter variation and a more realistic behaviour. With the aim of achieving the highest efficiency possible for the automotive drive, which means finding an optimal setting regarding fuel and power consumption, it is necessary to simulate the entire drive train of the vehicle. This includes the internal combustion engine (ICE) as well as electric traction machines or additional electric auxiliary drives. These vehicle simulations may be performed by the car manufacturer to obtain specifications for the vehicle components to be constructed by fulfilling the given boundary conditions like electric machines speed, power and torque and therefore the resulting currents and voltages for the optimal dimensioning of each component.","","978-0-7803-9760-6","978-0-7803-9761-3","10.1109/VPPC.2007.4544221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4544221","","Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Differential equations;Electric machines;Energy consumption;Fuels;Intelligent vehicles;Libraries;Permanent magnet machines;Vehicle driving","differential equations;electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;permanent magnet machines;synchronous motor drives;traction motor drives","Modelica-Dymola simulation environment;SmartElectricDrives Library;advanced simulation tool;automotive applications;differential equations;electric auxiliary drives;electric drives;electric traction machines;fuel consumption;internal combustion engine;permanent magnet synchronous machines;power consumption;vehicle drive train","","","","5","","7","","","20080617","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
