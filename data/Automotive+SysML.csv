This paper describes research into model based design of a particular automotive electronic system, using the SysML modelling language. Key diagrams have been identified and selected from the full set of SysML diagram types as being representative of a typical system development. This paper shows how to make use of those key diagram types to enable automotive engineers to model both architecture and functionality of the automotive electronic system.

Different teams may have to use different requirements modeling formalisms to express requirements related to their assigned parts of a given project. This situation poses difficulties in achieving interoperability and integration of requirements models for the purpose of reasoning on the overall system requirements. It is challenging to compose distributed models expressed in different notations and to reason on the composed models. In this paper we present a metamodeling approach which allows reasoning about requirements and their relations on the whole/composed models expressed in different requirements modeling approaches. In a previous work we expressed the structure of requirements documents as a requirements metamodel in which the most important elements are requirements relations and their types. The semantics of these elements is given in First Order Logic (FOL) and allows two activities: inferring new relations from the initial set of relations and checking consistency of relations. In this work we use the requirements metamodel as a core metamodel to be specialized for different requirements modeling approaches and notations such as Product-line and SysML. Mainly, the requirements relations in the metamodel are specialized to support relations in different requirements modeling approaches. The specialization allows using the same semantics and reasoning mechanism of the core metamodel for multiple requirements modeling approaches. To illustrate the approach we use an example from automotive domain expressed with two modeling approaches: product-line requirements models and SysML for system requirements.","1541-7719","","","10.1109/EDOC.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658275","SysML;model-driven engineering;product-line requirements;requirements metamodel;requirements reasoning","Automotive engineering;Cognition;Engines;Gears;OWL;Semantics;Unified modeling language","formal specification;formal verification;open systems;product development;project management;reasoning about programs;software development management;software prototyping;systems analysis","FOL;SysML;complex software development projects;composed models;distributed models;first order logic;interoperability;metamodeling approach;multiple requirements engineering approaches;multiple requirements modelling formalism;product-line requirements models;reasoning about requirements;reasoning mechanism;requirement documents;requirements model integration;requirements modeling approach;system requirements","","","","0","","","","","20131114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

System modeling based on an architecture description language is a way to keep the engineering information within one information structure. The EAST-ADL was developed in the EAST-EEA project (www.easteea.net) and is an architecture description language for automotive embedded systems. It is currently refined in the ATESSTproject (www.atesst.org). This paper gives an overview of the EAST-ADL and accounts for some recent refinements as developed in the ATESST project.

Interfaces between software and hardware components (SW/HW interfaces) play a fundamental role in these systems by linking the systems' control software to either the physical hardware components or to a hardware abstraction layer. Subsequently, safety certification of embedded systems necessarily has to cover the SW/HW interfaces used in these systems. In this paper, we describe a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach based on the SysML language, targeted at facilitating the certification of SW/HW interfaces in embedded systems. Our work draws on our experience with maritime and energy systems, but the work should also apply to a broader set of domains, e.g., the automotive sector, where similar design principles are used for (SW/HW) interface design. Our approach leverages our previous work on the development of SysML-based modeling and analysis techniques for safety-critical systems. Specifically, we tailor the methodology developed in our previous work to the development of safety-critical interfaces, and provide step-by-step and practical guidelines aimed at providing the evidence necessary for arguing that the safety-related requirements of an interface are properly addressed by its design. We describe an application of our proposed guidelines to a representative safety-critical interface in the maritime and energy domain.","1530-2059","978-1-4673-0107-7","","10.1109/HASE.2011.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113898","Model Driven Engineering;Safety Certification;Safety-Critical Systems;Software-Hardware Interfaces;SysML;Traceability","Context;Data structures;Guidelines;Modeling;Safety;Software;Unified modeling language","embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;safety-critical software","SysML;hardware abstraction layer;model driven engineering;safety certification;safety risks;safety-critical embedded systems;safety-critical software-hardware interfaces;safety-related requirements","","","","1","","7","","","20111229","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper put forward a model-based approach to design the in-vehicle networks and the software in ECUs with presenting a dependable platform compliant with OSEK/VDX specifications. The paper presents a tool-chain that covers the entire system development life-cycle including system modeling, model transformation, model analysis, network simulation, code generation, document generation and runtime instrumentation. In addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the approach. The contribution of the approach is threefold. First, the approach applies the theory of model-based design with OSEK/VDX standard in automotive electronics domain, and implements the transformation between SysML models and OSEK/VDX models through an efficient method. Second, the approach presents a method of software co-design among distributed ECUs.

In such systems, requirements are of different nature (software-related, system-related, functional or non functional) and must be traced through a multilevel design flow which integrates multiple tools and heterogeneous models. Validation and Verification (V&V) activities must be performed on models and on the final product to check whether they match the initial requirements. Results of design and V&V activities must be able to impact traceability information. We thus propose DARWIN4REQ, a metamodel for requirement traceability, based on three independent flows (requirement model, solution model and V&V model). The new metamodel establishes a link between these flows and affords full traceability of requirements, including those set for heterogeneous models. This paper presents the DARWIN4REQ metamodel and its use in the context of heterogeneous models for requirements modeling, design and V&V.

Later decisions to be made concerning appropriate operations that have to be undertaken are more difficult when the system architect starts facing design problems.

Such complex, interdisciplinary systems are also called mechatronic systems, referring to the synergistic integration of software, electronics and mechanics. To approach the complexity inherent in the discipline-spanning aspect, different development and integrations methods and techniques coming from the involved disciplines are applied. Especially the interdisciplinary aspect of mechatronics, makes it difficult to handle such development and still there is no such thing as a promoted unified mechatronic modeling and design language, which is capable of describing a joint model with sufficient details to manage the large number of involved system-aspects included in each of the representative domains-specific disciplines. In order to obtain a coherent model from the entire mechatronic system, an integrated model framework capable to manage various requirements and modeling specifications present in each discipline is needed.

Results show that the proposed approach allows designers to integrate easily accurate models in conceptual design level with a significant reduction in computing time.","2165-9400","978-1-4673-1370-4","978-1-4673-1371-1","10.1109/ESARS.2012.6387488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6387488","","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Vehicles","automotive components;control engineering computing;electric vehicles;machine control;mechanical engineering computing;power engineering computing;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","Modelica language;SysML language;complex system modelling;conceptual design level;design process;road electric vehicle modelling;road electric vehicle optimization","","","","0","","12","","","20121220","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In MADES, we propose an effective SysML/MARTE language subset and have developed new tools and technologies that support high level design specifications, validation, simulation and automatic code generation, while integrating aspects such as component re-use. The paper first illustrates the MADES methodology by means of a car collision avoidance system case study, followed by the underlying MADES language design phases and tool set which enable verification and automatic code generation aspects, hence enabling implementation in execution platforms such as state of the art FPGAs.","","978-1-4673-2570-7","978-1-4673-2571-4","10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322882","FPGAs;MARTE;Model Driven Engineering;Real-Time and Embedded Systems;Synthesis;SysML;UML","Clocks;Computational modeling;Embedded systems;Hardware;Resource management;Unified modeling language","automotive electronics;avionics;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;program compilers","FPGA;MADES FP7 EU project;automatic code generation;car collision avoidance system;effective high level SysML/MARTE methodology;effective model driven methodology;embedded avionics systems;high level design specification;real-time systems","","","","1","","24","","","20121004","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on over ten years of research and application the approach forms the basis of ACSE (Atego Context-based Systems Engineering). Many traditional approaches to systems modeling represent systems as high-level blocks and then show subsystems using aggregation and composition; providing a representation of a system as a structured hierarchy. This paper suggests that this structure-based approach is unrealistic and unreliable and proposes a context-based approach to systems modeling. Contexts represent systems from particular stakeholder's points of view; it is suggested that a combination of these contexts are used as a basis for systems modeling and, hence, understanding. Following this it is suggested that system of systems can be represented in this way, by defining higher-level contexts. This is illustrated thought a simple example demonstrating the principle of context-based system engineering.","","978-1-4244-8197-2","","10.1109/SYSOSE.2010.5544037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5544037","Context-based systems engineering;SysML;UML;system of systems","Automotive engineering;Best practices;Context modeling;ISO standards;Navigation;Poles and towers;Robots;Systems engineering and theory;Unified modeling language;Vehicles","systems engineering","Atego context based systems engineering;structure based approach;system-of-systems modeling","","","","2","","6","","","20100809","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
