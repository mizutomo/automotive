Second International Conference on","16-18 Dec. 2005","2005","","","7 pp.","","Model-based approaches are gradually applied in embedded system design with Unified Modeling Language (UML) and its profiles, but in terms of automotive electronics domain, few developers adopt UML to design system models because of inadequate tools that support the domain-specific modeling. This paper puts forward a model-based approach for automobile electronics software design and verification with a dependable platform compliant with OSEK/VDX standard. In addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the approach. The contribution of the approach is threefold. First, the approach applies the theory of model-based design with OSEK/VDX standard in automotive electronics domain. Second, the approach solves the transformation between UML models and OSEK/VDX models through an efficient method. Third, the approach simulates the system models and provides the designer with the results to optimize the design at design-level.","","0-7695-2512-1","","10.1109/ICESS.2005.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609882","","Application software;Automotive electronics;Design optimization;Electronic equipment testing;Embedded software;Embedded system;Software design;Software standards;Standards development;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;automotive electronics;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;formal verification;object detection;object-oriented programming;open systems;standards;vehicles","OSEK;Unified Modeling Language;VDX;automobile electronics software design;automobile electronics software verification;automotive electronics;embedded system design","","","","2","","18","","","20060403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such systems, requirements are of different nature (software-related, system-related, functional or non functional) and must be traced through a multilevel design flow which integrates multiple tools and heterogeneous models. Validation and Verification (V&V) activities must be performed on models and on the final product to check whether they match the initial requirements. Results of design and V&V activities must be able to impact traceability information. We thus propose DARWIN4REQ, a metamodel for requirement traceability, based on three independent flows (requirement model, solution model and V&V model). The new metamodel establishes a link between these flows and affords full traceability of requirements, including those set for heterogeneous models. This paper presents the DARWIN4REQ metamodel and its use in the context of heterogeneous models for requirements modeling, design and V&V. An automotive application illustrates the proposed approach based on UML-profiles such that SYSML, EAST-ADL2 and MARTE for design and on SIMULINK, SyNDEx and TIMESQUARE for V&V activities.","","978-1-4244-6638-2","978-1-4244-6639-9","10.1109/ICECCS.2010.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628611","Requirement modeling;automotive application.;model-based design;real-time embedded systems;traceability model;validation and verification","Adaptation model;Automotive engineering;Context modeling;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Safety;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;automotive engineering;embedded systems;program verification","DARWIN4REQ metamodel;EAST-ADL2;MARTE;SIMULINK;SYSML;SyNDEx;TIMESQUARE;UML-profiles;automotive embedded system;heterogeneous model-based design process;multilevel design flow;real-time embedded design process;requirements traceability modeling;validation activity;verification activity","","","","1","","","","","20101111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, there has been increasing use of model-based design and testing in automotive industry to reduce design errors, perform real-time simulations for rapid prototyping, and hardware-in-the-loop testing. For vehicle diagnosis, a global diagnosis method, which collects the diagnostic information from all the subsystem electronic control units (ECUs), is not practical because of high communication requirements and time delays induced by centralized diagnosis. Consequently, an agent-based distributed diagnosis architecture is needed. In this architecture, each subsystem resident agent (embedded in the ECU) performs its own fault inference and communicate the diagnostic results to a vehicle expert agent. A vehicle expert agent performs cross-subsystem diagnosis to resolve conflicts among resident agents, and to provide an accurate vehicle-level diagnostic inference. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to design an agent-based diagnosis architecture. A hybrid model-based technique that seamlessly employs a graph-based dependency model and quantitative models for intelligent diagnosis is applied to each individual ECU. Diagnostic tests for each individual ECU are designed via model-based diagnostic techniques based on a quantitative model. The fault simulation results, in the form of a diagnostic matrix, are extracted into a dependency model for fast fault inference by a resident agent. The global diagnostic inference is performed through a vehicle expert agent that trades off computational complexity and communication load. This architecture is demonstrated on the engine air induction subsystem. The solution is generic and can be applied to a variety of distributed control systems","","0-7803-8870-4","","10.1109/AERO.2005.1559668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1559668","","Automotive engineering;Centralized control;Communication system control;Computational modeling;Delay effects;Fault diagnosis;Performance evaluation;Testing;Vehicles;Virtual prototyping","automotive engineering;diagnostic expert systems;fault simulation;inference mechanisms;multi-agent systems","agent-based distributed diagnosis architecture;agent-based real-time fault diagnosis;automotive industry;cross-subsystem diagnosis;diagnostic matrix;distributed control systems;electronic control units;engine air induction subsystem;fault inference;fault simulation;graph-based dependency model;hardware-in-the-loop testing;model-based diagnostic techniques;rapid prototyping;subsystem resident agent;vehicle expert agent;vehicle-level diagnostic inference","","","","5","1","16","","","20051219","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, due to the complex nature of interaction among its components, any complex system has behaviors that may be highly unpredictable. Dealing with such behaviors requires a deep understanding of various ways to enable communication and account for complex traffic patterns among different components of the system. So far, successful design of many integrated systems has been primarily based on algorithms and design methodologies meant to work under deterministic conditions where communication is considered in an ancillary role. However, in the light of emerging systems and applications (e.g. networked cars and buildings, smart surfaces and dense networks for health monitoring, and multi-core chips at nanoscale) this deterministic, computation-centered mindset no longer offers an appropriate approach. Indeed, such systems are highly distributed and heterogeneous, unreliable and redundant, so new approaches, distributed and stochastic in nature, need to be developed. Consequently, we need to move from a deterministic, computation-centered to a probabilistic, communication-based design paradigm to compensate for the lack of predictable behavior which used to be the norm in traditional systems. We need to consider optimization strategies that work in distributed collaborative networks and find new ways to model communication and traffic distributions in cars, buildings, or chips. Starting from these overarching ideas, this special session is meant to address the concept of probabilistic, communication-centric design in a variety of contexts and identify specific design principles and optimization techniques that are poised to redefine the landscape of system design in the near future. The first talk by A. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli addresses- - distributed embedded systems, with particular attention to automotive electronic systems and intelligent buildings. The importance of selecting the communication protocols and architecture is underlined. The design criteria will be examined. The problem of distributing a complex application on a number of networked processing elements that may subjected to faults caused by harsh environments will be analyzed. The talk presents a unified approach to the design of these networks of embedded systems and the recent advances in automatic selection of protocols, topologies and architectures with examples in the automotive and intelligent building domain. The second talk by B. Nikolic addresses challenges in communications systems presented by the way radio spectrum is being shared today. It presents scenarios for the spectrum reuse on a dynamic basis, to achieve a more robust system for massive deployment of wireless terminals. Allocated, but unused portions of the spectrum are used by secondary, cognitive, basis. The ideas of packet multi-hop and spatial multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems will be discussed in this context. The third talk by R. Marculescu focuses on systems designed at nanoscale. The emphasis of presentation is on probabilistic modeling and optimization of emerging systems where communication happens via the NoC approach. Instead of taking the classical path of using queuing models for network optimization, this talk argues in favor of a substantial paradigm shift in network design based on adopting a quantum-like approach to model the information exchange and buffer behavior in NoC platforms.","","978-1-5959-3824-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753825","Embedded systems;distributed systems;low-power;multi-core chips;wireless communication","Buildings;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Embedded systems;Optimization;Probabilistic logic;USA Councils","embedded systems;large-scale systems;multiprocessing systems;optimisation;protocols;radio spectrum management;telecommunication computing","NoC approach;automotive electronic system;communication protocol;communication-centric design;complex system;distributed collaborative network;distributed system;heterogeneous multiprocessing;heterogeneous system;integrated system;intelligent building;multiple-input multiple-output system;networked embedded system;optimization;probabilistic modeling;radio spectrum","","","","0","","","","","20110421","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

For these reasons, embedded systems have became more complicated and require a lot of time for designing. Model-based programming has came into the spotlight in the embedded system industry that demands short time-to-market, especially in the automotive industry. Model-based programming allows the developer to design and implement the system easily by using blocks that provide automatic code-generation function. In addition, blocks provide the simulation function at the design and implementation step. Among the model-based programming's features, simulation is of greatest importance because accurate simulation can reduce cost, time and effort. Most simulators just estimate that the model works correctly without consideration of hardware characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes the new hybrid-block that can simulate not only functions of the model, but also features of hardware. We develop the 16-bit embedded system for the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in the automotive system and implement the hybrid-blocks that have two modes of automatic code-generation and simulation. The application model can be constructed by using the hybrid-block. In automatic code-generation mode, models can generate complete C program code for a specific platform without any modification. In simulation mode, the model can be simulated by considering the hardware and software characteristics of the model. In this paper, consequence of simulation with real-value in the 16-bit embedded system is compared.","","978-89-950038-6-2","978-89-950038-6-2","10.1109/ICCAS.2007.4406575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406575","Automatic code-generation;ECU;Embedded system;Model-based programming;Simulation","Application software;Automatic control;Automatic programming;Automotive engineering;Costs;Embedded system;Functional programming;Hardware;Mathematical model;Time to market","automatic programming;automobile industry;automotive electronics;digital simulation;embedded systems;program compilers","Matlab;Simulink;automatic code generation function;automotive industry;automotive system;complete C program code;electronic control unit;embedded systems;hardware characteristics;model-based programming","","","","0","","11","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Controllers designed based on H<sub>infin</sub> linear control theory tend to exhibit orders higher than or equal to the order of the original system. In this contribution, two methods were utilized in order to obtain a low order linear MIMO state space model equivalent to the nonlinear automotive Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) power system developed in [2]. The principles of input-output system identification (prediction-error minimization) and balanced model order reduction were utilized. In the first method, a linear 8<sup>th</sup> order state space model was estimated to best reproduce the outputs of the nonlinear system. Model order was lowered one order at a time and a state space model was identified. The one step ahead prediction outputs of the linear modes (8<sup>th</sup> order through 4<sup>th</sup> order) were compared to the nonlinear model outputs of several input-output data sets. Outputs of the aforementioned linear models and the outputs of the nonlinear model were very closely matched. The identified 4<sup>th</sup> order linear model was deemed very suitable to represent the PEMFC system. In the second method, a balanced model order reduction technique was utilized to obtain a truncated 4<sup>th</sup> order linear model directly from the identified 8<sup>th</sup> order model obtained by the first method. The outputs of the truncated model and the outputs of the nonlinear model matched very well. Each of the 4<sup>th</sup> order models was capable of capturing the dynamics of the PEMFC system and each of their performances was deemed highly satisfactory. A simple yet effective H<sub>infin</sub> loop shaping power tracking controller was designed in order to set the net output power of the stack to its desired levels following dynamic changes in load demand by means of manipulating the input voltage of the c- - ompressor motor. The H<sub>infin</sub> compensated system exhibited faster transient response, less overshoot, higher robustness and lower sensitivity margins when compared to the results of basic feed forward controllers presented in [2], [4], and [10].","","978-1-4244-2029-2","978-1-4244-2030-8","10.1109/EIT.2008.4554268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4554268","","Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Control theory;Fuel cells;MIMO;Power system modeling;Predictive models;State-space methods;System identification","H<sup>infin</sup> control;MIMO systems;control system synthesis;feedforward;identification;linear systems;nonlinear control systems;proton exchange membrane fuel cells;reduced order systems;state-space methods","H<sub>infin</sub> linear control theory;H<sub>infin</sub> loop shaping controller design;PEM fuel cell system identification;feed forward controllers;input-output system identification;linear MIMO state space model equivalent;low order linear models;model order reduction;nonlinear automotive proton exchange membrane fuel cell power system","","","","3","","14","","","20080627","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

ATS '07. 16th","8-11 Oct. 2007","2007","","","4","5","Test has long been recognized as the bridge between Design and Manufacturing. However, innovation and deep integration in design and test tools has not kept pace with the consumerization of electronics and the rapidly evolving nanometer IC design and manufacturing. As a result, the full potential of Test has not been harnessed by the mainstream semiconductor community. The consumerization of electronics places significant new demands on low power, correctness and time-to-volume production. The Test technologies need to innovate at a faster pace to enable system companies and their semiconductor suppliers - in segments ranging from automotive to entertainment and multi-media to meet these new challenges. The rapid advances in nanometer technologies pose another set of challenges, primarily related to integration. Whereas the integration at the level of interoperability amongst different tools in the design and implementation flows has been adequate in the past, nanometer technology introduces new levels of complexity due to the advanced physics effects and higher scales of transistor integration. This in turn results in complex interaction and interdependence amongst the different design steps such as synthesis, test, floor planning, placement, routing and chip finishing. The EDA industry needs to establish a new paradigm and a ""deep integration"" to meet these challenges and to deliver the productivity gains that will enable our customers to meet demands on functionality, correctness, quality and time-to-volume production. The paradigm needs to shift from ""Design For Test"" to ""Design With Test"", to fully model the tight interdependencies between design and test. During the design phase, DFT steps must integrate well during the design architecture, synthesis, timing and layout steps. Later, during the manufacturing phase, the benefits of DFT must be seamlessly harnessed for rapid scan diagnostics based yield learning using not only logic information from the design da- - tabase but also using timing and layout information. Such advances in innovation and integration will go a long way in moving the EDA industry from being a supplier of point tools to the role of a partner proactively anticipating and delivering on customers' needs. The keynote will discuss these challenges and possible solutions and scenarios.","1081-7735","978-0-7695-2890-8","","10.1109/ATS.2007.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4387972","","","consumer electronics;design for testability;nanotechnology","DFT;consumerization;design and manufacturing;design for testing;electronics;nanometer IC design;nanometer technologies","","","","0","","","","","20071121","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This talk will review several key challenges in design automation, including areas such as pre-silicon functional verification, design-silicon timing correlation, test cost and quality and describe data mining technologies to implement a prediction platform that provides unique solutions to cover these challenges. Results based on industrial cases will be discussed and other potential applications in design automation will be explained. In the functional verification space, we will demonstrate an iterative learning framework for reducing simulation costs and improving coverage. This framework is based on two learning components: a novelty test detector and a rule extractor. The novelty test detector is a test selection mechanism that analyzes the tests, produced by the RTPG tool, prior to simulation and identifies the tests that are more likely to hit coverage holes. The rule extractor learns from novel tests identified by novelty detection. The learning is used to refine the test generation process, so the resulting tests programs are more likely to hit coverage holes. The learning framework was evaluated using the simulation infrastructure for a commercial 64-bit, multi-thread micro- processor built in a 28nm node. Based on the evaluation of toggle coverage for the complex fixed integer unit, we demonstrate the ability to reduce the number of test programs by 95%. In addition, we also demonstrate the ability to extract rules from novel test programs. These rules are used to refine test generation, where the resulting tests hit additional known coverage holes. In design-silicon timing correlation, we will show a framework for analyzing design and test data for extracting knowledge that explains unexpected test results. This framework is evaluated using silicon measurements and design data from 30 high-performance dual-core SOCs. Over 2100 paths were measured on each part. For this design, the path measurements behaved differently than the- expected values determined by the STA tools as one cluster of paths performed better than expected while another cluster performed worse. Based on the evaluation of this framework, we demonstrate the ability to explain the fast and slow paths by generating simple reasons using the test data. These rules indicate that there is a design issue with a memory controller interface wrapper and these findings were later validated by domain experts. In the parametric tests space, we will show two different parametric tests analysis frameworks for reducing tests costs and improve test quality. The first framework will demonstrate the ability to learn a predictive models from the parametric test data to predict parts that are likely-to- fail after the entire burn-in cycle. This learning framework was evaluated using 8 lots of test data from a burn-in reduction experiment performed on a 3-axis accelerometer. Each lot contains 9k dies and over 500 parametric tests were performed on each device after 10, 24 and 48 hours of burn-in. Based on the evaluation, we demonstrate the ability to identify a large group of parts, ~98% of the total population, that do not require additional burn-in after 10 hours. This suggests that it is possible to save up to 78% in burn-in costs as we can reduce the burn-in time by a factor of 4.8 for most of the parts. The remaining 2% of parts are more susceptible to failing, where this small population includes all parts that fail after the entire burn-in cycle. The second framework will demonstrate the ability to learn from the parametric wafer test data of known customer return and apply these models to seen parts that will become field failures in the future. The learning framework was evaluated using 48 lots wafer probe test data for a high quality SoC from the automotive market. Each lot contained over 12k passing dies and one customer return. More than 1000 parametric tests were performed on each device.

Model-based function design and simulation are widely accepted and used by the Automotive EE community of today, to face some of the challenges. Emerging new standards - like AUTOSAR - bring standardized interfaces to low-level software, reducing cost and most importantly introducing a new level of abstraction to function implementers. Ease of software component reuse is another novel benefit brought by AUTOSAR. However, there is little guidance on how to translate the results of model-based function design into robust and efficient system implementations in a highly distributed environment. This paper outlines a proposed system level design methodology, supported by a set of point-tools, to bridge the Implementation Abyss. The flow covers: model transformation, architecture design, scheduling of networks and tasks distributed across multiple ECUs, harness design - followed by metrics and criteria-based evaluation of the resulting architecture.

We take an approach that allows the full simulation of the virtual mechanical control system including the mechatronics plant, microcontroller hardware and object code level software. This full virtual system simulation reveals the control system behavior, especially in microcontroller hardware and software. It enables microarchitecture design space exploration, control design validation, robustness evaluation of the system, software optimization before components design, and prevents potential problems. A novel aspect of this work is that the proposed virtual control system comprises all the components in a typical control system, therefore it enables the analysis of the effects from the different domains, for example the mechanical analysis of behavior due to a control software bug. To help the design, evaluation and analysis, we developed an integrated behavior analyzer into the development environment. This can display the processor behavior graphically during the simulation without affecting the simulation results, such as task level CPU load, interrupt statistics and software variable transition chart. This analyzer provides useful information on the behavior. No software modification is necessary for this virtual system analysis, and this analysis does not change the control timing and does not require any processing power on the target microcontroller. Therefore this method is suitable for real-time embedded control system design, in particular automotive control system design which requires high level reliability, robustness, quality and safety. In this paper, a Renesas SH-2A microcontroller model was developed on a CoMETtrade platform from VaST Systems Technology. An ETC (electronic throttle control) system is chosen as the plant to prove this concept. The ETB (electronic throttle body) model on Saberr- eg simulator from Synopsysreg was co-simulated with the SH-2A model. The SH-2A chip was under development during this project, nevertheless we could complete the OSEK OS development, control software design and verification using the virtual system. We confirmed that such software could run on an actual ETC hardware system without modification after a working sample chip was released at a later stage in the course of this work.

The usability of their HMIs (human-machine interfaces) has been improved considerably. However the complexity of the HMI software is growing. Testing the HMI became very demanding and time consuming. Because of multiplicity of HMI variants, a better code coverage is a goal for the development process of most manufacturers. Model-based testing is one way to achieve a better code coverage and keep the costs and complexity acceptable. However, the existing research approaches in the area of model-based HMI testing can not satisfy the needs for our testing purposes. In the work a model-based testing approach will be proposed for testing both the logical behavior and the graphical interface of the automotive infotainment HMI. As an important part of the testing approach a test-oriented HMI specification model will be designed. It is a model, which describes the required behavior of the HMI and contains the necessary information for the testing process. Test generation methods and the design of tests will also be proposed. These results can be generally used for testing advanced GUI-driven applications. Specific coverage criteria for infotainment HMIs, methods for automatic test generation and verification of the system behavior are also focuses of the work. The paper introduces the ideas and the goals of our model-based testing approach for infotainment HMIs.","","978-1-4244-7784-5","978-0-7695-4146-4","10.1109/VALID.2010.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617165","Automated HMI Testing;Infotainment System Tests;Model-Based Testing","Complexity theory;Data models;Electronic mail;Graphical user interfaces;Man machine systems;Software;Testing","automotive engineering;formal specification;graphical user interfaces;program testing","HMI specification model;HMI testing;automotive infotainment systems;graphical human-machine interface;graphical interface testing;logical behavior testing;model-based testing;test generation methods","","","","0","","10","","","20101101","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of a coherent multi-dimensional model across all development phases enables model-based design to generate systems that are correct by construction. Even some commercial support is available for code generation from higher-level models. However, such code generation capabilities are usually limited to uniprocessor targets and to a limited range of operating environments. SysWeaver (previously called Time Weaver) is a model-based development tool that includes a flexible syscode generation scheme for distributed real-time systems that can be easily tailored to a wide range of target platforms. In this paper, we present our work on creating an interoperable toolchain to automatically generate complete runtime code using models. The toolchain includes a simulation tool (Matlab) and its code generator (Embedded Coder) along with SysWeaver. In this chain, the functional aspects of the system are specified in Simulink, Matlabs modeling language, and translated into a SysWeaver model to be enhanced with timing information, the target hardware model and its communication dependencies. The final runtime code is then generated, automatically integrating the functional code generated with Embedded Coder and SysWeavers syscode. This syscode includes OS interfacing and network communication code with predictable timing behavior that can be verified at design time. Experiments with multi-node targets with end-to-end timing constraints in an automotive system show that many aspects of syscode and functional code generation can be automated. To our knowledge, this is the first time that multi-node executables including communication messages, functional behaviors and para-functional properties have been automatically generated using a general platform-independent framework.","1545-3421","0-7695-2516-4","","10.1109/RTAS.2006.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613339","","Application software;Computer languages;Embedded system;Hardware;Mathematical model;Multimedia systems;Real time systems;Runtime;System testing;Timing","","","","","","14","","14","","","20060424","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 2002 IEEE International Conference on","2002","2002","","","379","","Summary form only given.The concept of virtual integration platform plays a key role in any novel methodology that is trying to address earlier validation of distributed applications in regular and faulty conditions. The methodology must rely upon libraries that model the most important features of the commonly used IP's in the automotive segment such as FlexRay, the emerging bus protocol for safety critical applications supported by BMW, Daimler-Chrysler, Philips, Bosch, and Motorola, OSEK compliant RTOSes and protocol stacks, microprocessors such as Motoro/IBM PowerPC, Infineon 167, NEC v850, Tricore, ST 10, and Janus. We believe that tools must support the easy plug and play of the IP models in a seamless way to the user. For example, it must be possible to run a fast simulation at the token level (frames) to provide insights about the best network protocol configuration within a reasonable accuracy for the estimated frame latency. Next, it must be possible to export such a configuration to (semi)-automatically configure the downstream and more refined bus protocol models for the finer grain validation step. Both steps must rely upon interchangeable IP's with clear interfaces and trade-offs between simulation speed and accuracy of the timing estimates. In this paper, we present two examples of models of IP's that can be used at two different steps in the design exploration, the token-level/cycle approximate transaction based level and the cycle accurate level. The first example is the Universal Communication Model (UCM) that captures the main common features of the most relevant bus protocols such as topology, redundancy, arbitration, etc. The model enables quick token-level simulations. The user is able to determine the communication cycle layout and bus scheduling, k-matrix, and then export it for the configuration of downstream more refined models such as the Motorola FlexRay cycle accurate transaction based model. Bus delays are as important as task execution delays and RTOS switching overheads. In the second example we introduce Janus, a multi-processor micro-controller for power train applications. The cycle approximate transaction based model of Janus can be used to assess the ECU HW/SW partitioning, in particular to quickly explore different tas- k scheduling and allocation. Then, this model is refined and exported to configure a HW/SW co-verification tool for the cycle accurate validation of the ECU HW/SW architecture. In an example scenario, an engine control ECU is providing information about the engine (e.g. engine revolution speed) to a gear control ECU over a CAN bus (the latter typically requires precise revolution speed to operate and could also require to set the engine operation condition). In this scenario, car and subsystem makers play different roles in order to provide a virtual model of the system to validate the functionality and the performance before going to implementation. The same models can then be used to march toward implementation.","1063-6404","0-7695-1700-5","","10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106797","","Accuracy;Automotive engineering;Delay;Engines;Libraries;Microprocessors;National electric code;Plugs;Protocols;Safety","automotive electronics;embedded systems;systems engineering","IP models;Janus;automotive virtual integration;distributed applications;engine control;network protocol configuration;tools;virtual integration platform","","","","0","","","","","20030106","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particular strengths of Simulink are rapid design and algorithm exploration. Moreover, commercial tools are available to generate embedded C or HDL code directly from a Simulink model. On the other hand, Simulink models are purely functional models and, hence, designers cannot seamlessly consider the architecture that a Simulink model is later implemented on. In particular, it is not possible to explore the different architectural alternatives and investigate the arising interactions and side-effects directly within Simulink. To benefit from Matlab/Simulink's algorithm exploration capabilities and overcome the outlined drawbacks, this work introduces a model transformation framework that converts a Simulink model to an executable specification, written in an actor-oriented modeling language. This specification then serves as the input of well-established Electronic System Level (ESL) design flows that, e. g., enables Design Space Exploration (DSE) and automatic code generation for both hardware and software. We also present a validation technique that considers the functional correctness by comparing the original Simulink model with the generated specification in a co-simulation environment. The co-simulation can also be used to evaluate the performance of implementation candidates during DSE.

The design and calculation requires a noise parameter estimate of an integrated operational amplifier and even a multistage integrated operational amplifier. It is shown that the equivalent input noise voltage (E<sub>n</sub>) and equivalent input noise current (I<sub>n</sub>) are the reasonable expression for the noise characteristics of a multistage amplifier. This paper presents algorithms of the E<sub>n</sub>-I<sub>n</sub> noise model for integrated operational amplifiers of automotive electronic systems. This noise equivalent circuit model is derived by the noise correlation matrix, which represents the feedback network of an automotive electronic system. By conventional method for noise analysis of an electronic network, the output noise power is calculated with the sum of individual noises, and then the parameter is translated into the equivalent input noise voltage and input noise current. The novel approaches are based on the integer of all the noise sources and the noise relativity, so that the accuracy and efficiency are greatly improved and the algorithms are guaranteed to be more canonical. The algorithms may yield a better design of the low noise network of an automotive electronic system. A practical implementation for the extraction of the noise figure of a network is described in this paper. Simulated and calculated results of performance parameters of a network are presented.

The advantages of validating the design using high-level models can be lost entirely if errors and modifications that are not back-annotated to the higher abstraction levels are introduced when refining the design to lower levels of abstraction. To overcome this problem and to reduce design time, automatic synthesis has been used for the refinement process from Register Transfer Languages (RTLs) to logic gates for digital circuit design. This approach guarantees (assuming that the synthesis algorithms are correctly implemented) that the semantic of the RTL description is semantically equivalent to the semantic of the logic circuit. Automatic code generation is similar in intent and applicability. However, the software implementation of the abstract model must make efficient use of the platform resources that may not reflect all the assumptions of the code generation algorithms. The implementation of communication in a synchronous reactive model requires buffering and access procedures at the kernel level. In previous work, we obtained tight bounds on the size of communication buffers to maintain semantic equivalence. In realtime systems, however, because of the longer execution times of access procedures, an implementation with minimum buffer size may lead to the violation of deadlines. To solve this problem, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based optimization approach that provides the minimum memory implementation of a set of communication channels while guaranteeing that the task deadline constraints are met. The analysis is validated by an OSEK/VDX-compliant implementation that provides an estimate of actual runtime overheads. The approach is applied to a set of task graphs and an automotive case study.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2010.2064171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559439","Design optimization;OSEK;model-based design;real-time","Design optimization;Embedded systems;Formal verification;High level synthesis;Mixed integer linear programming;Real time systems","formal verification;integer programming;linear programming;logic design;logic gates;program compilers;telecommunication channels;telecommunication computing","abstraction level;code generation;communication buffers;communication channels;communication procedure synthesis;digital circuit design;formal verification;logic gates;mixed integer linear programming;real-time synchronous reactive models;register transfer languages;task deadline constraints","","","","2","","26","","2010-08-30","20101104","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Industrial Applications Society;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society;IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the field of system and acceptance testing requirements are the basis for all activities. Although, requirements are often not close to testing. To overcome this we introduced the Timed Usage Model (TUM) as a formal representation of requirements specification. During the creation of the model the requirements are analyzed and brought into an unambiguous and formal representation. Traceability is achieved, as each path in the model must be based upon a requirement. The formulation of the requirements in form of an unambiguous model clarifies the requirements and helps to detect design errors. During the creation of the model omissions and flaws in the requirements are discovered. The model serves as a communication medium when functionality responsibles are involved to clarify these aspects. Timed Usage Models were created for power train functionality and the energy management.

Zytek Automotive Ltd has developed an in-house multi-application modelling system for feasibility, proof of concept and desktop design optimisation of ICE, hybrid and pure electric vehicles. Model components contain a mix of simple physics such as energy conservation and vehicle dynamic behaviour, and empirical or component specification data. Components can interchangeably be specified at varying levels of complexity allowing modelled emphasis to be tailored to the target application. The model differs from commercially available alternatives in that it is driver based and incorporates feedback PID control of the vehicle's driver input sensor set. Driver interaction and the effects of driver behaviour on vehicle performance are simulated. Applications include fuel economy predictions for HEV programmes, EV range evaluation, control strategy design, evaluation and calibration optimisation, and the simulation of real world driving conditions. This paper provides a detailed overview of the model including its generic library based construction in the Matlab Simulink modelling environment. Application of the model to conventional ICE, HEV and EV vehicles is demonstrated.

Exploring these design alternatives in a virtual environment and evaluating them with respect to metrics such as cost, latency, flexibility and reliability provide an important competitive advantage to OEMs and help minimize integration risks later in the design cycle. In particular, the choice of the degree of decentralization of the architecture has become a crucial issue in automotive electronics.

FFA is a novel technique in which traditional fixtures used, for example, in automotive body assembly industries, are eliminated by the use of several robots, with multifinger grippers that are used to grasp and assemble parts. The objective of this work is to design, build, and test a reconfigurable gripper for the purpose of FFA. The gripper developed in this work is capable of precisely grasping parts of different geometries, rigidly holding the parts in space, and choosing different grasping points while allowing sufficient clearance for welding gun access. The overall design procedure, which is subdivided into the conceptual, configuration and parametric design, includes wrench system determination, kinematic and mechanism design. A novel three-finger gripper is developed. Each finger has two movable joints and two point-contacts with which to grasp the part. Finite element analysis is used to simulate deflections of the gripper components under load to determine critical design parameters. Finally, the workspace and the kinematic model of the reconfigurable gripper have been developed. The gripper was fabricated and tested in grasping experiments using several automotive body panels. The reconfigurable gripper is shown to achieve the objectives set out in this work.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2003.819704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291670","","Automotive engineering;Computational geometry;Fingers;Fixtures;Grippers;Kinematics;Robotic assembly;Service robots;Testing;Welding","automotive engineering;dexterous manipulators;finite element analysis;flexible manufacturing systems;grippers;manipulator kinematics;robotic assembly","automotive body panels;critical design parameters;design automation;dexterous manipulators;finite element analysis;flexible manufacturing systems;grasping points;robot based flexible fixtureless assembly;robot kinematics design;six degree of freedom reconfigurable gripper design;three-finger gripper;welding gun access;wrench system determination","","","","7","","21","","","20040504","","IEEE","IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Yield, the conformity to product specifications, is subject to critical design parameters such as dimensions, tolerances, and specification limits. The uncertainties in determining these parameters in design and manufacturing affect the process capability of producing high-quality products. Yield is a transparent and thus a desirable index, especially for multivariate process capability evaluation. Thus, yield sensitivity with respect to these design parameters indicates key contributors to final product quality, providing valuable information in design for quality control. Yield is formulated as a high dimension probability integral over a specification region. In multistage assembly processes, an assembly variation model links the quality characteristics to design parameters. This model is adopted in yield sensitivity analysis. Derivatives of yield with respect to the design parameters are developed using matrix calculus. Three sensitivity analysis algorithms, i.e., finite difference, yield derivative, and regression modeling, are implemented. Monte Carlo simulation is used for yield estimation in the three algorithms. A case study using floor pan assembly in automotive body manufacturing is presented for the validation of the proposed methodology.","1545-5955","","","10.1109/TASE.2009.2034633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345678","Assembly;process capability;sensitivity;tolerance","Algorithm design and analysis;Assembly;Automotive engineering;Calculus;Design for quality;Finite difference methods;Manufacturing processes;Sensitivity analysis;Uncertainty;Yield estimation","Monte Carlo methods;assembling;calculus;design engineering;finite difference methods;matrix algebra;probability;quality control;regression analysis;sensitivity analysis","Monte Carlo simulation;automotive body manufacturing;design evaluation;design parameters;finite difference;floor pan assembly;matrix calculus;multistage assembly processes;multivariate process capability evaluation;process capability sensitivity analysis;product quality;product specifications;quality characteristics;quality control;regression modeling;uncertainties;yield derivative;yield estimation;yield-based sensitivity analysis","","","","0","","21","","2009-12-04","20101004","","IEEE","IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This model-based control design reduces the calibration effort significantly (a major task faced by the automotive industry), while achieving the same performance as the fully calibrated engine controller. It is accomplished by using the intake manifold air pressure as scheduling variable; since this is also a state variable it yields a quasi-LPV model. A second parameter adjusting the gain of the controller is introduced to render it Calibratable while the robustness estimates still hold. It is demonstrated how online tuning of this single parameter optimizes the performance of the LPV model-based airpath controller.

In particular, functional correctness and reactive performance are increasingly difficult to verify. The advent of model-based design methodologies has alleviated some of the verification-related problems by making the code-generation process flow automatically from the model description. Given the relative infancy of this approach, several companies rely upon design flows based on different tools connected together by file transfer. This way of integrating tools defeats the very purpose of the methodology, introducing a high potential of errors in the transformation from one format to another and preventing formal analysis of the properties of the design. We propose to adopt a formal transformation across different tools and we give an example of this approach by linking two tools that are widely used in the automotive domain, Simulink and ASCET. We believe that this approach can be applied to any embedded software design flow to leverage the power of all the tools in the flow.","1530-1591","0-7695-2288-2","","10.1109/DATE.2005.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395728","","Airplanes;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Concurrent computing;Design methodology;Embedded software;Industrial control;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Software design","embedded systems;program compilers;program verification;software process improvement;software tools","code generation;correct-by-construction transformations;embedded software design;file transfer;formal analysis;formal transformation;functional correctness verification;model-based embedded software development;reactive performance verification;real time reactive systems","","","","2","","9","","","20050321","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, the registration methods use a fitting based algorithm, which is a recursive process and too time consuming to do quality inspection. Moreover, the fitting based algorithms require that the measured data and the CAD model have same shapes. Photogrammetry and ICP-based fitting algorithms are commonly used in this area. However, both of them cannot be applied directly to online point cloud registration for quality inspection. Since it requires: 1.) no markers on the object surface; 2.) a very limited inspection period of time for each part on an assembly line; and 3.) the measured work piece can not be assumed as same as the CAD model. The online registration is currently demanded by 3D surface inspection in automotive glasses manufacturing industry. The object-oriented registration method is developed based on matching the invariant geometric features between two data sets instead of the artificial markers and the recursive fitting algorithms. Therefore the registration speed is much higher. A datum filter is developed to extract the invariant features from the measured point cloud, based on the information that the CAD model carries. The curvature information and moment values are used as characteristic features to design the filter. The registration matrix is calculated by the invariance parts in both data sets. The new online registration method has been applied to the quality inspection in the windshield manufacturing industry. Experimental results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy.","","978-1-4244-2057-5","","10.1109/IROS.2008.4650877","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4650877","","Automotive components;Design automation;Information filters;Inspection;Meteorology;Shape;Solid modeling","CAD;automobile manufacture;automotive components;feature extraction;filtering theory;geometry;glass manufacture;image matching;image registration;inspection;matrix algebra;object-oriented methods;quality management","3D surface inspection;CAD model;automotive glasses manufacturing industry;automotive windshields;datum filter;invariant feature extraction;invariant geometric features matching;object-orientated registration method;online registration method;point cloud registration strategy;quality inspection;registration matrix","","","","2","","11","","","20081014","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

NO<sub>x</sub> emission must be regulated while NH<sub>3</sub> slip is maintained at acceptable level even during the transient driving cycle. The existence of SCR model, pointwise-in-time constraints and multiple control objectives motivate the application of model-based optimization-control approaches such as model predictive control(MPC).

The reuse of free-form feature information is achieving significant attraction in geometric modeling. Wavelet and its multiresolution analysis theory in CAGD/CG and CAD domains have been found to be very effective in treating geometric modeling and free-form feature surface design due to its properties of localization both in time/spatial and frequency domains. We introduce the fundamentals of wavelet and wavelet multiresolution analysis, and discuss how wavelet multiresolution technology is applied to design reuse for free-form feature shapes design by virtue of the wavelet decomposition and reconstruction algorithm. The approach indicates that the design information reuse of free-form feature surface not only improves the efficient of surface design, but is of great benefit to the surface modification and editing, and definite shape semantics, etc. We develop a multi-agent distributed system architecture environment supporting design information reuse.

Firstly, the physical and mathematical models of the two devices were established. The heat transfer situation was simulated to exclude unreasonable model. Secondly, the finite element analysis of the two devices was carried on using FLUENT. The simulated model was constantly modified by comparing the results with that of the mathematical model. In this study, FLUENT numerical analysis about the heat transfer and flow characteristics was taken on the model under four conditions. The conclusion obtained from that had great significance for the design. Finally, simulation system of the two devices was developed by the tool of MATLAB programming language and GUI design module. This simulation system can replace actual experiments by the way of analog computation. It can not only simulate performance of the system on different initial conditions to provide a decision-making basis for the optimal design of condenser and evaporator, but also shorten design cycles.","","978-1-4577-0320-1","","10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6067918","FLUENT;condenser;model;simulation platform","Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Heating;Integrated circuit modeling;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Numerical models","air conditioning;automotive electronics;decision making;finite element analysis;graphical user interfaces;heat transfer;programming languages","FLUENT numerical analysis;GUI design module;MATLAB programming language;automotive air conditioning devices;condenser;decision-making basis;evaporator;finite element analysis;flow characteristics;heat transfer;optimal design","","","","0","","5","","","20111103","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing control strategies for both the powertrain and its subsystems usually incorporate extensive feedforward maps because the systems of interest are nonlinear and difficult to model, operating ranges of interest are large, and maps are relatively inexpensive to implement. Augmenting or replacing such maps with dynamic feedforward control strategies based on predictive dynamic models can possibly provide significant performance improvements. The present work develops adjoint-based optimization approaches to: 1) identify the several unknown parameters of a nonlinear model of a powertrain torque converter and transmission using empirical data; and 2) based on this identified model, optimize the feedforward controls for a powertrain gear shift to achieve the desired shift characteristics.

It allows checking the observability property in a real time electronic system in order to improve its diagnosis capacity.To reach this objective, we have set up an iterative modeling process. The model of the real time electronic system represents the input for the simulation step, which precedes the property checking. It is possible to model the system in two different ways: either with a combined architectural and functional modeling using SystemC, or solely functional modeling using Matlab/Simulink. Then, we check the observability property of the system, if it is not verified, our contribution consists in adding a feedback to the modeling step to improve the model.

So variable LED array modules were developed, they are making great strides in terms of lumen performance and reliability, however the barrier to widespread use in general illumination still remains the cost or luminous efficiency, special requirements concerning optical properties and optomechanical layout have to be met.

The optical properties of the model were simulated using optical analysis software, its luminous efficiency is about 41 lm/W, the illuminance is about 50 lux when the distance is 1.5 m between the center of the model and measured spot, With the theoretically-optimized design of the LED model, experiments based on the results of the optimal simulation in the laboratory were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed LED model, it reaches a power factor of about 0.8 at 11 W.

Walter, ?Transitioning from federated avionics architectures to integrated modular avionics?, in Proc. 26th Digital Avionics Syst. Conf., Oct. 2007) but it is certainly general and applicable to other fields and in particular, automotive - in which software components can be supplied from multiple sources, integrated on the same hardware platform or physically distributed and possibly moved from one CPU to another without loss of functional and time correctness and providing a guaranteed level of reliability. This shift will decouple software design from the hardware platform design and provide opportunities for the optimization of the architecture configuration, increased extensibility, flexibility and modularity. However, the integration of software components in a distributed system realizing a complex functional behavior and characterized by safety, time and reliability constraints requires a much tighter control on the component model and its semantics, new methods and tools for analyzing the results of the composition, whether by simulation or formal methods, and methods for exploring the architecture solution space and optimizing the configuration. We provide a general overview of existing challenges and possible solutions to the design and analysis problem, <i>with - - special focus on the automotive domain</i>. The development of such methods and tools must necessarily consider compatibility with existing modeling languages and standards, including UML, AUTOSAR and synchronous reactive models, on which the widely used commercial products Simulink and SCADE are based.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2039550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440059","Architecture;automotive electronic system;automotive software;design methodology;design space exploration;system design","","automotive electronics;computational complexity;electronic engineering computing;reliability;software engineering","ECU;IMA;aeronautics architectures;architecture configuration;automotive architectures;cost pressure;distributed system;electronic control units;exchanging messages;extensibility;federated architectures;flexibility;functional complexity;functional correctness;fundamental paradigms;hardware components;hardware platform design;integrated architectures;integrated modular avionics;optimization;software components;synchronous reactive models;time correctness","","","","14","","70","","","20100329","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The machine proposed is a low voltage and high current structure able to develop the power requested by the application. The design procedure meets difficulties and solves them in manner of core saturation at high current and high power density. The analytical design procedure is detailed for the proposed machine. Discussing of high phase currents, a validation of the design needs to be approached, based on FEA method. The direct instantaneous torque control (DITC) is employed as the machine is addressed to automotive applications. As it is known that the torque ripples of the SRM are high when using only hysteresis control of the currents hence these will create discomfort to the driver. With DITC, the torque can be smoothened in order to obtain increased comfort of the passenger. In order to implement DITC method, a Matlab Simulink program was created to simulate the SRM, based on lookup tables containing the flux and torque variations function the current and rotor position, fetched from the FEA model of the machine. The program created this way offers the possibility of fast simulation of the machine and allows in the same time the possibility of implementing several control procedures.","","978-1-4673-2230-0","","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625176","DITC;FEA;automobile applications;switched reluctance machine (SRM)","Magnetic flux;Reluctance motors;Rotors;Stator windings;Torque","automotive engineering;control system synthesis;electric current control;finite element analysis;machine control;reluctance machines;table lookup;torque control;transport control;voltage control","DITC;FEA;Matlab Simulink program;core saturation;direct instantaneous torque control design;finite element analysis;flux variation function;high phase current position;hysteresis current control;lookup table;low voltage high current SRM;power density;rotor position;small automotive application;switched reluctance machine;torque ripple;torque variation function","","","","0","","","","","20131010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once the vehicle weight reduction by down-gaging sheet metal and down-sizing reinforcements becomes of importance, the fatigue performance of spot welds will be a critical factor in design and analysis. Since most of the existing analytical approaches are still deterministic and too complicated to use, this paper presents a simple deterministic model for spot welds under tensile-shear type of loading and a reliability-based model for design and analysis criteria. The simple model is developed on the nominal stress around the weld, defined as the ratio of the load per weld to the net cross sectional area. The load per weld can be easily calculated from any FEA codes with rigid elements for the spot welds. Also, the reliability spot-welded fatigue model is derived on the assumption that the fatigue life and the stress amplitude follow the Weibull and Beta distributions, respectively. Several examples are illustrated to determine the design stress amplitude, the useful fatigue life and the probability of failure. Moreover, the database for the statistical fatigue properties of spot-welded specimens in tensile-shear tests are generated for the reliability analyses","","0-7803-1786-6","","10.1109/RAMS.1994.291104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=291104","","Automotive engineering;Design methodology;Electric resistance;Fatigue;Sheet materials;Spot welding;Surface cracks;Surface resistance;Tensile stress;Testing","fatigue;reliability;resistance welding","Beta distributions;FEA codes;Weibull distributions;automotive industry;down-gaging sheet metal;down-sizing reinforcements;fatigue life;fatigue-reliability analysis;resistance spot-welds;statistical fatigue properties database;stress amplitude;tensile-shear loading;vehicle weight reduction","","","","1","","11","","","20020806","24 Jan 1994-27 Jan 1994","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Model-checking based techniques can provide accurate estimates of worst-case end-to-end latency, as they are based on exhaustive state-space exploration. However, state-space explosion may limit their applicability to small and medium sized systems. In this paper, we present an abstract system model that can be used for model-checking based latency computation, leading to a major increase in scalability.

In recent years, high to ultra high power LED's are becoming a light source option for virtually every automotive lighting system. For exterior automotive lighting, these light sources have distinct advantages, but also unique thermal issues compared to conventional incandescent light sources. This study describes two methods of determining the junction temperature of an LED or array of LED's, direct and indirect. Both are based on temperature measurements, but the indirect method also requires a thermal resistance specified by the manufacturer. The direct method utilizes the intrinsic behavior of the junction voltage drop at low current (<0.1mA). A computer model for a typical plate finned heat sink design for a high power LED automotive lamp was experimentally calibrated. Design of experiment analysis was performed using a 3 level 3 input factor full factorial test matrix. The factors were defined as an active heat sink surface area, convection coefficient correlated to an airflow, and environment temperature. A quadratic model is generated from the results of the factors and significant interactions to the response.","1065-2221","1-4244-09589-4","1-4244-09589-4","10.1109/STHERM.2007.352403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4160884","DOE;LED;automotive lighting;heat sink design;junction temperature measurement","Automotive engineering;Heat sinks;Light emitting diodes;Light sources;Low voltage;Manufacturing;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Temperature measurement;Thermal resistance","LED lamps;automotive electronics;design of experiments;heat sinks;light sources;lighting;thermal management (packaging)","LED components;automotive lamp;automotive lighting system;heat sink design;junction temperature;light source;plate finned heat sink;temperature measurements;thermal considerations;thermal resistance","","","","14","1","11","","","20070423","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The uptake of AUTOSAR for the integration of application software, with common embedded device driver components, offers the opportunity for the partitioning and business model of automotive electrical architecture design to change. Currently control of a system is centralised into a single function specific ECU requiring hard wiring to all sensors and actuators. Situations such as this lead to an over complication in system partitioning, unnecessary wiring and connectors, and often a large number of medium performance ECUs integrated by a number of CAN buses. A neater, simpler and more cost effective solution to the design and system partitioning problem may be to reduce the number of specialist ECUs integrated by CAN and replace with generic ECUs integrated with a faster network such as FlexRay. The problem then becomes how to determine the trade off between all of the possible design parameters which may include cost, electronic control system functionality, sensor/actuator placement. This paper describes an investigation into cost modelling of a vehicle electrical architecture to support decisions on system partitioning and in-vehicle control network choice. A LIN bus cost model is developed and it is shown how this can in turn be developed into a cost model for the entire vehicle electrical architecture based on hardware and software costs.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-815-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383632","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20071119","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

The results show that hybridization allows a significant improvement in the hydrogen economy through the recovered energy from breaking.

How well these tasks are performed significantly impacts the quality of the developed software system. The difficulty of these tasks is greatly exacerbated for the software of embedded systems as these systems are commonly used for critical applications, have to operate reliably for long periods of time, and usually have a high degree of complexity. Current embedded systems software development practice, however, often deals with the (requirements) analysis phase in a superficial manner, instead emphasizing design and implementation. This research investigates how an approach similar to the well-known design patterns, termed object analysis patterns, can be applied in the analysis phase of embedded systems development, prior to design and coding. Specifically, our research explores how object-oriented modeling notations, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), can be used to represent structural and behavioral information as part of commonly occurring object analysis patterns. This work also investigates how UML-based conceptual models of embedded systems, based on the diagram templates in the object analysis patterns, can be automatically analyzed using the Spin model checker for adherence to properties specified in linear-time temporal logic (LTL) using a previously developed UML formalization framework. We have applied these patterns to several embedded systems applications obtained from the automotive industry. This paper describes one of our case studies and illustrates how our approach facilitates the construction of UML-based conceptual models of embedded systems and the analysis of these models for adherence to functional requirements.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2004.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377192","","Application software;Automatic logic units;Embedded software;Embedded system;Information analysis;Object oriented modeling;Pattern analysis;Programming;Software systems;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;embedded systems;formal specification;formal verification;object-oriented methods;object-oriented programming;software quality;temporal logic","Spin model checker;Unified Modeling Language;automotive industry;behavioral information;design pattern;embedded system;linear-time temporal logic;object analysis pattern;object-oriented modeling;software development;software system;structural information","","","","13","","53","","","20050110","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since the active suspension system has nonlinear and time-varying characteristic, it is difficult to establish an accurate dynamic model for designing a model-based controller. Here, a functional approximation based adaptive sliding controller with fuzzy compensation is proposed for an active suspension system. The functional approximation technique is employed to represent the unknown functions, it releases the model-based requirement of the sliding mode control. In addition, a fuzzy scheme with online learning ability is employed to compensate the modeling error of the functional approximation with finite number of terms for reducing the implementation difficulty. To guarantee the control system stability, the update laws of the approximation function's coefficients and the fuzzy tuning parameters are derived from the Lyapunov theorem. The proposed controller is employed on a quarter-car numerical model.

A method to handle the complexity of automotive software is Model Based Design (MBD). As MBD offers great advantages in early simulation and testing, it has become today's mainstream method for automotive software engineering. However, some aspects can be initially tested after the integration of software on real hardware components (usually by the supplier) and when all parts of a system (e.g. bus systems, sensors, actuators) are present. The consequence is that the requirement specification of the according system possibly contains gaps that can lead to software defects. New technologies like the AUTOSAR standard enable additional potentials for the validation of model based developed software. Due to the AUTOSAR software architecture it is possible for an OEM to realize an early ??virtual?? software integration with an acceptable effort and perform at next step a front loading of system tests. In this paper we present an approach that improves the quality of the requirement specification artifacts by using test front loading. In detail, we analyze the requirement engineering part of the software development process to identify aspects that can not be tested without having all system components. Afterwards, we classify these aspects and define an abstract test pattern that can be globally used for testing.

"Taming complexity while gaining efficiency: Requirements for the next generation of test automation tools","Bansal, A.; Muli, M.; Patil, K.","dSPACE Inc., Wixom, MI, USA","AUTOTESTCON, 2013 IEEE","16-19 Sept. 2013","2013","","","1","6","The current product development environment for mechatronic systems is characterized by tight budgets, reduced development times and immense complexity across the industries - aerospace, automotive, commercial vehicles, etc. A huge emphasis is being given to increase the efficiency in product testing and to make the process more productive in increasing quality, while being cost effective. Companies are seeking software testing tools that offer a comprehensive solution that helps in achieving this goal. Automated software testing for both hardware and the software components is one of the ways the industries are trying to gain efficiency in testing. Given the fact that current mechatronic systems are quite complex, have large numbers and types of IO channels, and are implementing distributed real-time control with multiple communication protocols, a test automation tool that incorporates and tests all of the system functionality is highly desirable. In particular, due to the focus on software quality, as more and more functions are added to the network of Electronic Control Units (ECU), a greater emphasis is laid on the requirements for a comprehensive automated testing tool. The efficiency in development and planned increase in reuse of test assets is an important consideration for efficiency gain. Bringing clarity to the test description would improve readability and maintainability of these test assets. This paper shows the lessons learned from a similar evolution in Model-Based Design, moving from handwritten code to model-based graphical executable representation, can be applied to the testing arena to develop better and more efficient tests. To make the testing process efficient, the test tool should be able to not just execute tests, but organize the test results and present them in a manner easily understood by the end user. The user should be easily able to select tests to be executed and visualize execution results of those tests without need of external - ata analysis and reporting tools. A user should also be able to gather data related to test execution for reporting on overall software quality metrics. In the case of real-time embedded systems, the traditional approach for software testing of test execution, data capture, analysis and reporting creates a lot of inefficiency and repeated testing. A new approach to run test evaluation in parallel to test execution, using the so-called real-time testing solution, eliminates these inefficiencies and results in significant gains in testing time and improving utilization of the test infrastructure. Globalized, distributed development environments may lead to organizations adopting a variety of tool chains and test platforms. Therefore, to gain efficiency, it is desired that the test automation solution should offer easy integration with other third-party test platforms and be independent of the hardware to protect the investment in the long run. Basing such integration interface on established standards gives the user freedom to make choices. Some standards, such as HIL API from ASAM, are being proposed for test systems in the automotive industry. The paper reviews applicability and benefits of such standards. Various industry standards, such as automotive functional safety standard ISO 26262, IEC 61508, IEC 62304 and DO-178C, have addressed requirements for software testing and test tools. It is therefore critical that the selected test automation tool provide support for the prescribed methods and support the standard compliant development process. Tool qualification is a critical topic addressed by these standards and is discussed in this paper. Further, increasingly important requirements such as integration with the overall software development process, management of tests and test data, test reusability, hardware platform independence, test development and execution efficiency, etc. are discussed.","1088-7725","978-1-4673-5681-7","","10.1109/AUTEST.2013.6645055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645055","Automated Testing;HIL;Real-time systems","Automation;Complexity theory;Industries;Real-time systems;Software;Standards;Testing","automatic testing;mechatronics;standards","automated software testing;comprehensive automated testing tool;electronic control units;hardware platform;mechatronic systems;model based design;model based graphical execution;product development environment;real time testing solution;real-time embedded syste;software testing tools;test asset reuse;test automation tools;test reusability;test standard;testing complexity;testing efficiency","","","","0","","","","","20131024","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This comes along with the demand for more and more processing power, paving the way for multi-core architectures, and widespread use of real-time operating systems. Application software implementation and operating system configuration strongly influence the overall system behavior. Design methodologies for such complex systems, consisting of hardware, software and real-time operating systems, must provide an early, model-based view on the overall system. The approach described in this paper enables automatic generation of system-level models of complex systems from abstract application specifications. Additionally, a compiler-based technique allows automatic calculation of precise software runtime information and annotation of the generated model. The resulting system-level model facilitates early exploration of systems on high level of abstraction, taking into account functional and temporal characteristics of hardware, software and real-time operating system. A key feature of the approach is its high accuracy, which is shown by applying it to an industrial application from the automotive domain.","1063-6404","978-1-4244-8936-7","","10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5647795","","Biological system modeling;Hardware;Instruments;Operating systems;Pipelines;Runtime","embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;operating systems (computers);program compilers","RTOS-aware modeling;compiler-based technique;embedded hardware-software system;system-level model","","","","0","","15","","","20101129","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The gap between early requirement specifications and the development of electronic control units for specific features is bridged with an approach using executable specifications. Behavioral and non-functional properties of the system to be designed can thus be evaluated early during the design process, which improves the confidence of strategic design decisions. Moreover, the executable system model serves as an interface description for module designers, which eases the problem of system integration. The problem of increasing resources for system simulation and optimization is treated by an approach of accuracy adaptive system simulation.

Therefore, the provision for investment-based incentives by countries is perceived as a way of supporting industry competitiveness. Despite this being a global phenomenon, there is no formal process to guide the offer of industry incentives. The process of designing such incentives is often based on intuition rather than on formal models, making it difficult to assess such industry interventions objectively and to improve on them. Specific to South Africa, the offer of incentives to the automotive industry to support its competitiveness has had mixed results. In particular, investment in R&D has remained minimal. The paper presents a system dynamics model as a proposed instrument in formalising the offer of incentives, applied to the South African governmentpsilas offer of incentives to the automotive manufacturing sector. The model was developed from qualitative and quantitative information on how the incentive dispensation had been structured. Simulations with the incentive model reveal that the incentive dispensation, as a stand-alone intervention, has had a significant and positive effect on industry investment, but has had no specific policy lever to direct investment into R&D and consequent innovative activities. By this measure, the model has not been a strong policy instrument for supporting long-term industry competitiveness.","","978-1-890843-17-5","978-1-890843-18-2","10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599634","","Africa;Art;Automotive engineering;Instruments;Investments;Machinery;Manufacturing industries;Process design;Pulp manufacturing;Vehicle dynamics","automobile industry;government policies;incentive schemes;innovation management;investment","R&D;South African government;automotive industry;automotive manufacturing sector;industry competitiveness;innovative activity;investment-based incentives;state-of-art machinery;system dynamics approach","","","","0","","20","","","20080815","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A class of adaptive critic designs that can be classified as (model-free) action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming is used in the present project. Adaptive critic designs are defined as designs that approximate dynamic programming in the general case, i.e., approximate optimal control over time in noisy, nonlinear environment. The present work uses a system, called ""critic"", to approximate the cost function in dynamic programming and thus to achieve optimal control. The goals of the present learning control design for automotive engines are emissions reduction and maintenance of optimal performance under various operating conditions. Using the data obtained from a test vehicle, we first develop a neural network model of the engine. A neural network controller is then designed based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control. In the simulation studies, the initial controller is trained using the neural network engine model developed rather than the actual engine. We have developed and tested self-learning neural network controllers for both engine torque and exhaust airfuel ratio control. For both control problems, good transient performance of the neural network controller has been observed. A distinct feature of the present technique is the controller's real-time adaptation capability based on real vehicle data which allows the neural network controller to be further refined and improved in real-time vehicle operation through continuous learning.","0743-1619","0-7803-8335-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383945","","","adaptive control;control system synthesis;dynamic programming;internal combustion engines;learning systems;neurocontrollers;optimal control;pollution control;torque control","adaptive critic learning techniques;air-fuel ratio control;automotive engine control;emissions reduction;engine torque;heuristic dynamic programming;learning control design;neural network;optimal control","","","","4","","36","","","20050124","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model was designed for eventual use in a Fault Diagnoser built for an automobile engine system. While using this model in Extended Kalman Filter based estimators for fault residue generation, it was noted that the model suffered from biases that impaired the quality of estimation results. The biases were found to originate from the inherent simplifications associated with MVEMs. This led to an understanding of the limits of accuracy of a traditional MVEM model, the need for accurate bias modelling and the development of more robust estimators.

Second, an individual outlier model can be learned for each failing part. We show that this approach is suitable for learning failing parts such as customer returns, where each may have a unique failing behavior.

Proceedings","9-12 March 1999","1999","","","4","","Abstract only given, as follows. The increasing demand for dynamically controlled safety features, driving comfort and operational convenience in upper class cars require an intensive use of ECUs (electronic control units) including software. A network of up to 70 ECUs which are communicating via buses is mandatory for the required functionality. On the one hand, complexity of ECUs is rapidly increasing and time to market is decreasing. On the other hand, automotive electronics is developed together with many suppliers under control of the OEMs. Furthermore, 30% of the value added in automotives is up to electronics. Thus, from a technical, an administrative and from a business point of view the car manufacturers have a vital interest to improve and shorten the software development process for ECUs together with all partners involved. As a consequence, a general objective is to improve the ECU development process based on standards. Besides OSEK as an already accepted standard for ECU software operating systems in Germany, the OEMs are also interested in standards for bus systems or for model exchange formats, to mention just a few. In addition, an improved ECU design process covers system analysis, system specification, system design, automatic code generation, an integration of ECUs and the corresponding software in a real environment as well as calibration and after sales services. This presentation gives an overview about the current situation in automotive electronics design, presents a new design process and discusses the challenges.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761088","","Automotive electronics;Automotive engineering;Consumer electronics;Manufacturing processes;Process design;Software safety;Software standards;Systems engineering and theory;Time to market;Vehicle safety","automotive electronics;design engineering;standards;systems analysis;systems engineering","ECU hardware architecture development;OEM;OSEK;automatic code generation;automotive electronics;bus systems;car manufacture;dynamically controlled safety features;electronic control units;model exchange formats;software development process;standards;system analysis;system design;system specification;systems engineering","","","","2","","","","","20020806","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

EmCodeSyn is an attempt to create a formal semantics based visual framework for specifying safety critical applications such as automotive control, avionics fly-by-wire control, etc. In contrast with SIMULINK/Stateflow, LabVIEW and other visual tools, EmCodeSyn is based on a synchronous programming paradigm akin to the polychronous language SIGNAL. The formalism on which this work is based, is called MRICDF (multi-rate instantaneous channel connected data flow). The specification formalism has relational semantics, which enables static rate-analysis for scheduling the computation in the code generation stage. Hierarchical data flow specification with minimal amount of control specification makes it easier for designers to compose existing MRICDF models to create larger ones. Once the feasibilty of an MRICDF design is verified, code synthesis is performed by the tool to generate C code. EmCodeSyn design methodology provides a visual framework for generating verifiable deterministic code from synchronous specification based on MRICDF formalism.","1636-9874","","978-2-9530504-1-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5404049","","Application software;Clocks;Debugging;Design methodology;Equations;Flow graphs;Network synthesis;Software safety;Software tools;Synchronous generators","embedded systems;formal specification;program compilers;program debugging;programming language semantics;safety-critical software","C code;EmCodeSyn;MRICDF;automotive control;avionics fly-by-wire control;code generation;code synthesis;embedded applications;formal semantics;multirate data flow specifications;multirate instantaneous channel connected data flow;polychronous language SIGNAL;safety critical applications;scheduling;static rate-analysis;synchronous programming;visual debugging","","","","1","","15","","","20100202","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the industrial policy support of ""revitalized planning of automobile industry"" has been brought forward by Chinese government in the early 2009, has eased up the impact of the economic crisis to Chinese automobile industry in a certain extent, how to enhance the comprehensive competitiveness of enterprises by such improvements as logistics costs is the challenges to Chinese government and its automotive industry. On the basis of the investigation of several Chinese AMFs (Automobile Manufacturing Firms) and their SDNs (Supply-Demand Networks), this paper analyzes the current constraint factors of logistics integration of Chinese automotive industry. It also proposes a integrative system design to adapt the logistics development of Chinese automotive components and spare parts by using such logistics technologies as materials direct delivery, cross-transshipment and postpone production, etc.. Around the three functional modules of flexible logistics planning, real-time resources control and deployment, and knowledge reuse and share, this paper builds a global logistics systematic model of Chinese automotive components and spare parts. It provides not only the effective protection for normal operation of automobile assembly and spare parts supplying system, but the logistics systematic supports for the realization of the standardization, personalization, modular and platform.","","978-1-4244-4638-4","978-1-4244-4639-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5301609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5301609","","Automobile manufacture;Automotive components;Automotive engineering;Costs;Forward contracts;Government;Industrial economics;Logistics;Manufacturing industries;Supply chains","automobile industry;automotive components;government policies;logistics;microeconomics;production planning","Chinese automobile industry;Chinese automotive components;Chinese government;automobile manufacturing firms;economic crisis;flexible logistics planning;global economic crisis;global logistics integrative system;industrial policy support;revitalized planning;supply-demand networks","","","","0","","5","","","20091030","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the characteristics of multi-process and multi-procedure manufacturing technology, the production efficiency and machining precision of those parts are greatly limited. In this paper, a unified geometric modeling method for precision machining of thin-walled parts is presented. The unified model is established to represent the polymorphism of process surface for every stage in the whole machining process. Then with four variables, including design surface model, process surface model, offset transform and localization transform as well as the interactions among them, different application problems are described, which reveal the common mathematical essence. Firstly, for the process design of thin-walled parts, nonuniform allowance optimization design method is proposed based on the stable process stiffness. Secondly, for the rapid clamping and localization of thin-walled parts, a method of alignment localization with constraints and allowance optimization is presented for the near-shape blank. Thirdly, for the machining process controlling of thin-walled parts, a modeling and compensation method of elastic deformation error is developed in the multi-axis NC machining. Finally, several examples show that the geometric modeling method is feasible and the results can carry high precision and efficiency for thin-walled parts.","","978-1-4799-1656-6","","10.1109/ISAM.2013.6643459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6643459","Process geometric model;allowance optimization design;constraint alignment;error compensation;stable process stiffness","Error compensation;Machining;Mathematical model;Optimization;Process control;Surface treatment;Transforms","aerospace components;automotive components;blanking;elastic deformation;machining;optimisation;precision engineering;process design;ships;thin wall structures","aerospace manufacturing;automotive manufacturing;design surface model;elastic deformation error;localization transforms;multiaxis NC machining;near-shape blank;nonuniform allowance optimization design method;offset transforms;precision machining;process design;process surface;process surface polymorphism;ships manufacturing;thin wall parts;unified geometric modeling method","","","","0","","","","","20131024","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Surprisingly, in practice the elicitation and specification of requirements remained largely unaffected by the introduction of model-based methods, while much effort has been spent on the introduction of functional specifications. As a consequence, where functional specifications exist, these are often created unsystematically and are of poor quality, leading to further problems during design, implementation and testing.

Many design and implementation errors are avoided by synthesizing code from model-based software specifications using automatic code generators such as ETAS' ASCET. To verify non-functional properties of the implementation, model-based design processes should be complemented with static program analysis tools like Abslnt's StackAnalyzer and timing analyzer aiT.

However the efficient development of reliable control software is difficult. We have proposed to introduce a “model-based design” process using MATLAB/Simulink, established in the automotive and aerospace fields, to the development of power electronics systems. However, it was difficult in the past because calculating switching circuit as the plant model is difficult in MATLAB/Simulink due to the socalled stiff equation problem. Thus, in this study, we have developed a simulation environment in which the standard model-based design tool, MATLAB/Simulink, and the simulation engine for power switching circuits, SCALE, work cooperatively. SCALE was originally developed to solve stiff equation and efficiently simulate power switching circuits. This software environment enables us to design control algorithms with intuitive block diagram expression and test them in actual hardware, without writing a C program. Furthermore to improve this environment, a mechanism that handles the multiple sample rates was introduced. Smart energy systems that use several controllers with different sampling rates can be simulated in the proposed environment. Thus, we can develop control software for smart energy systems in a timely and cost effective manner.","","978-1-4673-2328-4","978-1-4673-2329-1","10.1109/ICRERA.2012.6477477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477477","control;model-based design;simulation;software","Batteries;Computational modeling;Control systems;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Software packages","C language;control engineering computing;power electronics;power engineering computing;smart power grids;switching circuits;switching convertors","C program;Matlab-Simulink;SCALE;aerospace fields;automotive fields;block diagram expression;complex control software;control algorithms design;multisample-rate controllers;power converters;power electronics systems;power switching circuits;reliable control software;sampling rates;simulation environment;smart energy applications;standard model-based design tool;stiff equation problem","","","","0","","7","","","20130314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Center, Vienna","Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2008","14","6","1699","1706","Interactive steering with visualization has been a common goal of the visualization research community for twenty years, but it is rarely ever realized in practice. In this paper we describe a successful realization of a tightly coupled steering loop, integrating new simulation technology and interactive visual analysis in a prototyping environment for automotive industry system design. Due to increasing pressure on car manufacturers to meet new emission regulations, to improve efficiency, and to reduce noise, both simulation and visualization are pushed to their limits. Automotive system components, such as the powertrain system or the injection system have an increasing number of parameters, and new design approaches are required. It is no longer possible to optimize such a system solely based on experience or forward optimization. By coupling interactive visualization with the simulation back-end (computational steering), it is now possible to quickly prototype a new system, starting from a non-optimized initial prototype and the corresponding simulation model. The prototyping continues through the refinement of the simulation model, of the simulation parameters and through trial-and-error attempts to an optimized solution. The ability to early see the first results from a multidimensional simulation space - thousands of simulations are run for a multidimensional variety of input parameters - and to quickly go back into the simulation and request more runs in particular parameter regions of interest significantly improves the prototyping process and provides a deeper understanding of the system behavior. The excellent results which we achieved for the common rail injection system strongly suggest that our approach has a great potential of being generalized to other, similar scenarios.","1077-2626","","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658193","Index Terms&#8212;common rail injection system;interactive computational steering;interactive visual analysis;simulation","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Manufacturing industries;Multidimensional systems;Prototypes;Rails;System analysis and design;Virtual prototyping;Visualization","automotive engineering;data visualisation;design engineering;engineering graphics;interactive systems;mechanical engineering computing;rapid prototyping (industrial)","automotive industry system design;common rail injection system;coupled steering loop;interactive visual analysis;interactive visual steering;rapid visual prototyping","","","","8","","24","","","20081024","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditional design methodologies involve writing a text specification and implementing algorithms in C. However, algorithms cannot be verified without hardware. This approach leaves the engineer in the unenviable position of waiting for the last piece of hardware to arrive to enable them to test their system.

SmartC is a hierarchical modeling language and implements the SmartOSEK operating system model. The SmartC models are classified into four levels, namely module level, task level, subtask level and component level. In the SmartC models, control-flow oriented models and data-flow oriented models are integrated in the hybrid SmartC models. At the task level, the model is constructed based on the control flow, whereas the component level model is constructed based on the dataflow. In SmartC programs, all inter-task communication, task triggering mechanisms, and access to guarded global variables, are automatically generated by the SmartC generator which generates the C code from the SmartC code. Having well-structured concurrency mechanisms, SmartC greatly reduces the risk of concurrency errors, such as deadlock and race conditions. The SmartC language is implemented on the automated manual transmission (AMT) control system and is compatible with the OSEK/VDXspecifications.

Quite a few relational standard part databases can be found on the market, however none of them properly address the design needs. While querying relational databases, results are mostly vague or irrelevant, hence it requires domain experience about the features of parts. On the other hand semantic search [1] by the help of graphic model, it is possible to navigate and access all standard parts on graph; it returns relevant results as usual. In this paper, we propose semantic based search engine for inquiring standard parts from the repository. In our approach, we model and store Standard Part data on a commercial RDF (Resource Description Framework) Database [2]. We used OWLIM [3] to store data on database and we created an intelligent search engine, which discover link relations on RDF data.

The first part is a parameter study, combining factorial design with production line simulation including emulated control systems and resulting in a simplified performance model based on multiple linear regression. The second part is an optimisation on the simplified performance model using the Nelder Mead simplex method aiming at production optimisation. Due to the complexity in a modern production line, it is not possible to create a useful model representation of the entire control system code/function. Therefore, the proposed optimisation method is based on using production line simulation including emulated control systems with the real IEC 61131-3 control code.

Architecture-level engineering practice demands notations, which concentrate on certain aspects of system functionality, while other aspects (such as communication and scheduling) are implicitly encoded in the language semantics, and realized using HW/SW components such as operating systems and protocol stacks. We describe a system-level design methodology targeted for automotive control applications. Models in a simple graphical component-based input language are compiled into complex system models incorporating abstractions for hardware, operating systems, and inter-processor communication. System models are based on the synchronous AutoFocus notation and are used as a basis for formal analysis such as systematic worst-case response time analysis.

Control of automotive engines is important because it yields benefits on several issues such as fuel efficiency, exhaust emission reduction and better power delivery. Quantitative design of robust control systems proposes a transparent and practical controller design methodology for uncertain single-input single-output and multivariable plants. Since the engine Throttle Valve dynamic has multivariable nonlinear transfer functions, in this paper QFT technique is used for designing the proposed controller. After linearization of model, a robust controller is designed for tracking problem. Next, simulation for tracking problem has been carried out which indicates successful design of controller. There are several steps involved in the design of mentioned controller. The main steps involved in designing are template generation and loop shapingdesign.

A network/platform model in SystemC forms the backbone of the virtual prototyping, which bridges control software and physical environment. The network/platform model consists of processing elements abstracted by real-time operating systems, communication systems, sensors, and actuators.

One way to deal with this is to design an unknown input observer to estimate those unknown variables. However it is not feasible, if measurement noises corrupt the estimator significantly. This paper proposes a new approach in the design of an unknown input estimator with proportional and integral terms. Unlike existing high gain or sliding mode based unknown input observers where the high gain is applied at the proportional error term, the proposed one applies the high gain at the integral term, which will render of less sensitivity to measurement noises without sacrificing estimation accuracy. The reduction of measurement noises effect is due to the property of the integrator that can significantly diminish measurement noises. The presented techniques can also be applied to a class of uncertain systems to estimate both the unknown states and disturbances with less sensitivity to measurement noises and less restrictive conditions than those of the previous approaches. Two case studies will be presented for the application of the proposed estimator to automotive engines: The first one is a feedback linearization controller synthesized with the unknown input observer for airpath controls of turbocharged diesel engines and the second one is to reconstruct the signal of the thermal sensor which has a slow response.","0743-1619","978-1-4244-4523-3","978-1-4244-4524-0","10.1109/ACC.2009.5160117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5160117","","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Diesel engines;Linear feedback control systems;Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear systems;Vehicle dynamics","automobiles;diesel engines;feedback;linearisation techniques;nonlinear systems;observers;temperature sensors;uncertain systems","airpath controls;automotive engine controls;feedback linearization controller;nonlinear systems;thermal sensor;turbocharged diesel engines;uncertain systems;unknown input estimation;unknown input observers","","","","0","","16","","","20090710","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of the jet-based heat exchanger is compared to the baseline channel-flow heat exchanger via CFD modeling. We also characterized the thermal performance of the channel-flow-based heat exchanger experimentally to validate the CFD predictions. CFD results indicate that the jet-based heat exchanger can provide up to 45% lower thermal resistance, 79% increase in power density, and 118% increase in specific power with respect to the baseline channel-flow heat exchanger. We also initiated experimental characterization of the reliability of jet impingement on a plain surface as well as on microfinned/enhanced surfaces.

The reason is that the well-known triangle-based structure lighting method is only valid for parts with diffuse reflection property. To measure the 3-D profile of a glass surface, specially an automotive windshield, a new robot-assisted back-imaging system is introduced in this paper. Using the mirror property of the glass, encoded patterns are projected from an LCD monitor and recorded by two cameras. The distortion of structured light patterns, caused by the curvature of the glass, is used to calculate the 3-D shape. Different from the traditional structured light methods, the back-imaging system can simultaneously calculate both the coordinates and normal of the surface, which is particularly required by the glass industry. Furthermore, this paper also introduces a robot planning/control system that integrates the measurement constraints, vision model of the new back-imaging sensor, and the computer-aided design model together to automatically move the back-imaging sensor for 3-D shape measurement. The proposed methods have been implemented, and the sensor is installed on an ABB robot for measuring an automotive side-door glass.

SmartC is a hierarchical modeling language and implements the SmartOSEK operating system model. The SmartC models are classified into four levels, namely module level, task level, subtask level and component level. In the SmartC models, control-flow oriented models and data-flow oriented models are integrated in the hybrid SmartC models. At the task level, the model is constructed based on the control flow, whereas the component level model is constructed based on the data flow. In SmartC programs, all inter-task communication, task triggering mechanisms, and access to guarded global variables, are automatically generated by the SmartC generator which generates the C code from the SmartC code. Having well-structured concurrency mechanisms, SmartC greatly reduces the risk of concurrency errors, such as deadlock and race conditions. The SmartC language is implemented on the automated manual transmission (AMT) control system and is compatible with the OSEK/VDX specifications.

The optimization results show that the weight of frame can be reduced by 8%, showing that the scheme is an effective way to achieve automotive lightweight design.","","978-1-4673-1722-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6330487","FE Optimization;Lightweight;Truck frame","Iron;Optimization;Sensitivity analysis;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles;Vibrations","design engineering;finite element analysis;optimisation;road vehicles;vehicle dynamics","automotive lightweight design;dump truck frame;dynamic response characteristics;experimental mode analysis;finite element model;frame weight change;lightweight design;optimization","","","","0","","12","","","20121015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the intrinsic high power dissipation, the performance requirement for power products are extremely high, especially in handling harsh thermal and electrical environments. The design rules and material and structure layout of power packaging are quite different from regular IC packaging. This talk will present a state-of-art and in-depth overview of recent advances, challenges and opportunities in power electronic packaging design and modeling. A review of recent advances in power electronic packaging is presented based on the development of power device integration. The talk will cover in more detail how challenges in both semiconductor content and advanced power package design and materials have co-enabled significant advances in power device capability during recent years. Extrapolating the same trends in representative areas for the remainder of the decade serves to highlight where further improvement in materials and techniques can drive continued enhancements in usability, efficiency, reliability and overall cost of power semiconductor solutions.

This kind of purely mechanical load is one of the main failure causes in automotive electronics. A test vehicle has been designed to enable vibration testing on SMD capacitors (size 0805). The test vehicle is distinguished with a line clamping and stripe shape which both leads to a concerted loading of the component solder joints. The test vehicles were analysed for their resonant frequency prior test and loaded with a sinusoidal vibration close to the resonant frequency for certain numbers of cycles. The loading of the individual components was measured using a vibrometer. Components were stressed with wave amplitudes from 0.3 mm up to 0.8 mm and normalised cycle counts from 1 up to 12. All tests were accomplished at room temperature. Cross sectioning was performed to evaluate damage location within and cracking of the solder joints. The observed damage location clearly differs to results from temperature cycling tests. Cracking of the intermetallic interface was not observed. Cracks propagated in the solder bulk. This enables a solder fatigue model since no interface effect is involved in the damage process. For a detailed analysis of the stress distribution within the solder joints and the determination of a damage criterion a 3D finite element model of the test vehicle was utilised. Transient analysis was performed to gain stress data for various settings of wave amplitudes. Characteristic stress values are derived for the different load intensities. The Basquin equation provides a possibility to model the life time for high cycle fatigue scenarios where only elastic deformations are assumed. Based on this Basquin equation a life time model for the solder joints was determined finally. Numbers of cycles to failure are taken from experiments and characteristic stress values from simulation to determine the model parameters.","","978-1-4577-0107-8","","10.1109/ESIME.2011.5765838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5765838","","Deformable models;Frequency measurement;Lead;Optical devices;Optical variables measurement;Position measurement;Vibration measurement","automotive electronics;dynamic testing;failure analysis;fatigue cracks;finite element analysis;solders;stress analysis;surface mount technology;transient analysis;vibrations","3D finite element model;Basquin equation;SMD capacitors;SMD components;automotive electronics;component solder joints;intermetallic interface cracking;lead-free solder joints;life time prediction;line clamping;mechanical load;resonant frequency prior test;sinusoidal vibration;solder fatigue model;solder joint cracking;stress distribution;stripe shape;temperature 293 K to 298 K;temperature cycling tests;transient analysis;vibration loads;vibration testing;vibrometer","","","","1","","5","","","20110512","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The study is focused on a temperature-controlled car seat solution, less considered in literature and by manufacturing companies. The fuzzy approach for the controller ensures a high robustness of the solution for a large variety of operational conditions and parameters of the systems. First, an experimental platform was designed for the identification of the thermal behavior of the seat. Several microcontrollers were put into operation for a control cycle and for data acquisition. Then a training stage for an artificial neural network was designed in order to generate a fuzzy model for the thermal behavior of the seat. Finally, a fuzzy controller was added in a global model and its validity has been checked using a simulated model. The design and the experiments were focused on the seat back of the driver for a device already equipped with a resistive heater. Specific programs were realized for the platform control using a modern integrated development environment based on graphical programming, virtual instrumentation and real-time code generation. The study proves also that even in the fuzzy design, stated as simple and fast, a complex systemic approach is a metric of the validity and of the robustness of the solution.","","978-1-4673-1809-9","","10.1109/ICATE.2012.6403436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6403436","","Automotive engineering;Data models;Heating;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Training","automobiles;automotive components;automotive engineering;control system synthesis;data acquisition;fuzzy control;microcontrollers;neurocontrollers;robust control;seats;temperature control;thermal conductivity","air temperature control;artificial neural network;automotive;control cycle;data acquisition;driver seat back;fuzzy control;fuzzy design;fuzzy model;graphical programming;microcontroller;real-time code generation;resistive heater;robustness;system parameter;temperature-controlled car seat solution;thermal behavior identification;virtual instrumentation","","","","1","","21","","","20130107","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus on real-time response of a component as a basis for exploration and allow the developer model it using constant values or parameters. To quantify the parameters, we propose a novel constraint synthesis technique to correlate response times of interacting components.

The need for a more innovative and higher-level design flow that directly incorporates model simulation with hardware implementation is needed. Simulink is a well-known tool which allows designers to model a system at a high level and is ideal for certain classes of applications, such as automotive control. The complication of using such a tool for both modeling and hardware implementation is that there currently exists no tool chain to generate hardware from the basic Simulink blockset.

Soon Ethernet will start to oust MOST bus in its domain of info- and entertainment applications. However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with the deployment of an Ethernet-based backbone that integrates all automotive domains on a single layer at increased bandwidth, reduced complexity and cost, while opening car intelligence for future innovations. Such backbone must transport critical control data in real-time. Standard Ethernet requires extensions to comply with the strict timing requirements of driver assistance and safety applications while simultaneously supporting broadband multimedia traffic. In this paper, we compare IEEE 802.1 AVB and Time-triggered Ethernet, two competing real-time approaches. While the first fosters over- provisioning and prioritisation, the second is based on a coordinated time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) policy for media access. By simulating a realistic in-car backbone design and traffic model, we reveal the strengths and weaknesses of both protocols and point to the diverging characteristics of event- and time-triggered policies. Our results show that in this in-car network scenario both protocols are able to meet the rigid timing requirements, while each has its unique benefits and disadvantages.","1090-3038","978-1-4673-1880-8","978-1-4673-1879-2","10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6398932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6398932","","Cameras;Jitter;Media;Protocols;Real-time systems;Streaming media;Synchronization","mobile radio;multimedia communication;protocols;telecommunication traffic;time division multiple access;wireless LAN","AS6802 time-triggered Ethernet;Ethernet-based backbone;Ethernet-based in-car communication;IEEE 802.1 AVB;TDMA policy;automotive industry;broadband multimedia traffic;car intelligence;control data;coordinated time-division-multiple-access policy;driver assistance;event-triggered policy;in-car backbone design;in-car interconnect;media access;protocols;safety applications;technologically integrated in-car network;time-triggered policy;traffic model","","","","1","","19","","","20121231","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The successful design for reliability of electronic packages depends on understanding and modeling the fatigue behavior of these materials. Both mechanical and thermal loadings are varying in a cyclic manner in test or field conditions. To establish an adequate constitutive model describing the thermo-mechanical behavior under cyclic mechanical and thermal loading, material testing is required on a dedicated test specimen. Current specimen geometries which are used to describe fatigue behavior of highly filled epoxy-based materials fail to describe the mechanical behavior. They contain stress concentrations near the clamping area, which leads to the failure within these areas and not in the reduced section of the beam. In this paper, a new test sample with dogbone geometry is designed by utilizing finite element analysis (FEA). A design space (DoE) is used to analyze the effect of important parameters (e.g. thickness, length and radius) that influence the stress distribution. The optimum design point is selected by FEA of stresses in the reduced section of the beam and near the clamping. In order to validate the simulations, experiments are done with samples, which are produced with the help of PTFE coated steel molds. This approach is shown to improve the existing dogbone designs and validity of the low cycle fatigue testing.","","978-1-4673-6138-5","","10.1109/EuroSimE.2013.6529889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529889","","","adhesives;automotive electronics;design of experiments;electronics packaging;fatigue testing;finite element analysis;reliability","DoE;FEA;automotive application;automotive electronics;beam;clamping;constitutive model;dogbone geometry;dogbone specimen;electrical interface;electronic package;epoxy-based adhesive;fatigue behavior;finite element analysis;finite element based design;low cycle fatigue testing;mechanical loading;reliability;stress concentration;stress distribution;thermal interface;thermal loading;thermo-mechanical behavior","","","","0","","7","","","20130613","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its meaning is known very well for the ordinary people, ordinary in the sense of being not associated with the automotive industry. One of the strategies for NOx emissions reduction in personal vehicles with combustion engine is the Selective Catalytic Reduction System. The critical issue of such systems can be too high urea temperature at the injector outlet. Engine compartment around the injector influences very much the injector temperature. This temperature can be estimated with a model based on interpolation maps and correlation factors. Parameters of the model can be evaluated using genetic algorithms. Main issue of this work was researching for best identification method of the parameters of the engine compartment. First, easy genetic algorithms has been designed and coupled to the temperature model, than two experiment have been defined to check various method, where changing of settings of genetic algorithms and then several runs have been performed. To evaluate which setting are most suitable, spread of the found parameters have been compared. In first two experiment absolute values of the parameters have not been exposed, third experiment has been introduced to validate short the chosen method.

This paper presents an improvement of code generation technology for SR obtained via a novel algorithm for optimizing the multitask implementation of Simulink models on single-processor platforms with limited availability of memory. Existing code generation tools require the addition of zero-order hold (ZOH) blocks, and therefore additional memory, and possibly also additional functional delays whenever there is a rate transition in the computation and communication flow. Our algorithm leverages a novel efficient encoding of the scheduling feasibility region to find the task implementation of function blocks with minimum additional functional delays within timing and memory constraints. The algorithm is applied to an automotive case study with tens of function blocks and very high utilization to test its applicability to complex systems.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2010.2072511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582169","Code generation;Simulink;mixed-integer linear programming (MILP);real-time programming;schedulability;software models","Computational modeling;Delay;Embedded systems;Mixed integer linear programming;Multitasking;Random access memory;Real time systems","aerospace industry;automobile industry;embedded systems;program compilers;software engineering","Simulink models;aeronautic industry;automotive industry;code generation technology;correct-by-design software;embedded control systems;functional delays;multitask implementation synthesis;software development;synchronous reactive model;zero-order hold blocks","","","","7","","25","","2010-09-23","20101104","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Industrial Applications Society;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society;IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A reduced-order model and a detailed simulation model of the powertrain are created for control design and evaluation of fuel economy, respectively. A heuristic rule-based controller is used for testing the impact of different component combinations on fuel economy. After a suitable combination of engine, motor, and ultracapacitor sizes has been determined, a model predictive control strategy is created for power management which achieves better fuel economy than the rule-based approach. Various component sizing and control strategies tested consistently indicate a potential for 5% to 15% improvement in fuel economy in city driving with the proposed mild hybrid powertrain.

These electrical steel grades are optimised over a wide frequency range to achieve the specific material property compromise of magnetic, electric, mechanical and thermal performance. Moreover, to maximise the potential of these advanced electrical steel grades, careful machine design is needed: when optimising the machine's power density for instance, it's crucial not to over-dimension the machine, neither in magnetic nor in mechanical aspects of the electrical steel laminations. Therefore more precise modelling tools are becoming more essential: ArcelorMittal developed an improved approach for the iron loss modelling of machines based on a better model description and appropriate material characterisation of the relevant phenomena influencing the machine's iron losses (such as lamination punching and pressing of the stacks). Furthermore, ArcelorMittal has also in-house advanced mechanical characterisation tools such as fatigue testing on electrical steels, for tighter mechanical machine design.

Changes to roadway infrastructure have reduced the severity of automotive crashes; however, it is driver performance which remains a primary contributing factor to these incidents. An on-board vehicle control system, using combined steering and differential braking, provides enhanced safety by removing driver error from the recovery process once the ROR event has been identified. In this study, two control algorithms, based on sliding mode and state flow theories, have been designed to automatically recover a vehicle from this dangerous scenario. A driver model was also developed based on experimental data gathered at a tire manufacturer's test track. The controllers were numerically evaluated for a common road departure and return situation with comparison to the empirical driver model. The results show that both controllers safely recovered the vehicle and outperformed the driver steering model. Specifically, the state flow controller reduced recovery time by 40% compared to the sliding mode controller, while the driver model resulted in vehicle spin out.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6669117","","Numerical models;Roads;Tires;Torque;Vehicle crash testing;Vehicles;Wheels","braking;control system synthesis;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles;steering systems;variable structure systems","automotive crashes;control algorithms;controller design;differential braking;driver performance;driver steering model;empirical driver model;on-board vehicle control system;road departure;road return;roadway infrastructure;sliding mode control;state flow controller;state flow theories;steering;vehicle recovery;vehicle run-off-the-road;vehicle spin out","","","","0","","","","","20131202","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a method for calculating the near field electromagnetic radiated emissions from a typical electrical load, used in a dual voltage automotive distributed architecture, is presented. The electrical load is an electrical drive with a 42/14 V DC/DC step-down converter devoted to fuel pumping. The method is based on the computation of the magnetic vector potential of a uniform current element and on the ""image theory"" and has been suitably validated by means of experiments. The calculation of electromagnetic radiated emissions requires only a time domain current measurement and does not present computational burden. The radiation model allows the prediction of radiated disturbance and the development of EMC oriented design and optimisation criteria of the vehicle electrical architecture.

In fact, on the one hand, having a human driver on a driving simulator allows automotive OEMs to bridge the gap between virtual prototyping and on-road testing during the vehicle development phase. On the other hand, novel driver assistance systems (such as advanced accident avoidance systems) can be safely tested by having the driver operating the vehicle in a virtual, highly realistic environment, while being exposed to hazardous situations. In both applications, it is crucial to faithfully reproduce in the simulator the drivers perception of forces acting on the vehicle and its acceleration. The strategy used to operate the simulator platform within its limited working space to provide the driver with the most realistic perception goes under the name of motion cueing. In this paper we describe a novel approach to motion cueing design that is based on Model Predictive Control techniques. Two features characterize the algorithm, namely, the use of a detailed model of the human vestibular system and a predictive strategy based on the availability of a virtual driver. Differently from classical schemes based on washout filters, such features allows a better implementation of tilt coordination and to handle more efficiently the platform limits.","2153-0009","978-1-4577-2198-4","","10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6083053","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","automotive engineering;driver information systems;predictive control;road safety;virtual prototyping","MPC approach;advanced driver assistance devices;automotive OEMs;driver perception;driving simulators;human vestibular system;model predictive control techniques;motion cueing algorithms;on-road testing;predictive strategy;tilt coordination;virtual driver;virtual prototyping","","","","2","","7","","","20111117","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This would lead in the optimization possibility of the complete vehicle (including all ancillaries, output electrical converter and their dedicated control laws). Nevertheless, the fuel cell system model is strongly dependent of many physico-chemical parameters that are difficult to evaluate on a real proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack. Moreover, the analytical relations governing the behavior of a PEMFC system are also far from being easy.

As the software platformization of vehicles advances, the demands for reconfigurable cars, installing and upgrading vehicle software as plug-and-play have also grown. However, the existing automotive software platforms are not designed for dynamic reconfiguration and plug-and-play. This paper addresses the plug-and-play challenge in the recent automotive systems. Drawing from recent advancements in the mobile phone operating systems, we propose an Android-based software architecture which supports the play-and-play in automotive systems. In our architecture, an application can be downloaded from cloud services and executed on ECUs in a distributed fashion. Before installing an application, our system performs schedulability analysis to check real-time performance requirements for recent vehicles. We also present a model-based development tool for designing a workflow of automotive applications for our system. We implement a prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.","","978-1-4673-1044-4","","10.1109/ICOS.2012.6417614","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6417614","automotive;middleware;plug-and-play;software platform;workflow","Androids;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Humanoid robots;Real-time systems;Software;Vehicles","Linux;automotive electronics;cloud computing;middleware;mobile computing;software architecture;software tools","Android-based automotive middleware architecture;Android-based software architecture;ECU;automotive application workflow design;automotive software platforms;cloud services;mobile computing platforms;mobile phone operating systems;model-based development tool;plug-and-play;real-time performance requirements;reconfigurable cars;schedulability analysis;software platformization;vehicle software installation;vehicle software upgrade","","","","0","","16","","","20130124","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Interfaces between software and hardware components (SW/HW interfaces) play a fundamental role in these systems by linking the systems' control software to either the physical hardware components or to a hardware abstraction layer. Subsequently, safety certification of embedded systems necessarily has to cover the SW/HW interfaces used in these systems. In this paper, we describe a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach based on the SysML language, targeted at facilitating the certification of SW/HW interfaces in embedded systems. Our work draws on our experience with maritime and energy systems, but the work should also apply to a broader set of domains, e.g., the automotive sector, where similar design principles are used for (SW/HW) interface design. Our approach leverages our previous work on the development of SysML-based modeling and analysis techniques for safety-critical systems. Specifically, we tailor the methodology developed in our previous work to the development of safety-critical interfaces, and provide step-by-step and practical guidelines aimed at providing the evidence necessary for arguing that the safety-related requirements of an interface are properly addressed by its design. We describe an application of our proposed guidelines to a representative safety-critical interface in the maritime and energy domain.","1530-2059","978-1-4673-0107-7","","10.1109/HASE.2011.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113898","Model Driven Engineering;Safety Certification;Safety-Critical Systems;Software-Hardware Interfaces;SysML;Traceability","Context;Data structures;Guidelines;Modeling;Safety;Software;Unified modeling language","embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;safety-critical software","SysML;hardware abstraction layer;model driven engineering;safety certification;safety risks;safety-critical embedded systems;safety-critical software-hardware interfaces;safety-related requirements","","","","1","","7","","","20111229","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automotive Engine Torque and Air-Fuel Ratio Control Using Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming","Javaherian, H.; Derong Liu; Kovalenko, O.","Gen. Motors R&D, Warren","Neural Networks, 2006. IJCNN '06. International Joint Conference on","0-0 0","2006","","","518","525","In this paper, we present our work on self-learning engine control using ""derivative"" adaptive critics. In the derivative version of adaptive critic designs, the derivative of the cost function of dynamic programming with respect to the state of the process is estimated. As the goal of dynamic programming is to maximize the overall cost function, direct estimation of the cost function derivatives will naturally lead to better algorithm performance. In our previous studies of the regular version of adaptive critic techniques, a model of the process for controller training was not necessary. However, for the implementation of the ""derivative"" version of adaptive critic designs, a process model in the form of neural network is required. In this way, the derivative information can be propagated back to the controller in order to update the controller parameters. The objectives of the present learning control design for automotive engines are to improve performance, reduce emissions and maintain optimum performance under various operating conditions. Using data from the test vehicle equipped with a 5.3 L V8 engine, we built a neural network model of the engine. The model is then used in the development of self-learning neural network controllers based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control for both engine torque and exhaust air-fuel ratio control. The goals of the engine torque and air-fuel ratio control are to track the commanded torque and to regulate the air-fuel ratio at specified set-points, respectively. For both control problems, reasonably good neural network controller transient performance under a wide range of operating conditions have been achieved and reported.","","0-7803-9490-9","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716137","","Adaptive control;Automotive engineering;Cost function;Dynamic programming;Engines;Neural networks;Optimal control;Programmable control;State estimation;Torque control","automotive components;dynamic programming;heuristic programming;internal combustion engines;neural nets;torque control;unsupervised learning","adaptive critic designs;air-fuel ratio control;automotive engine torque;controller parameters;cost function maximization;dual heuristic dynamic programming;function controller training;optimal control;self-learning engine control;self-learning neural network controllers","","","","3","","","","","20061030","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The precondition for the breakthrough of virtual training is that it overcomes the problems of former approaches. The paper presents the design approach taken during the development of a game-based, virtual training system for procedural assembly knowledge in the EU-FP7 project VISTRA. One key challenge to address when developing virtual assembly training is the extensive authoring effort for setting up virtual environments. Although knowledge from the product and manufacturing design is available and could be used for virtual training, a concept for integration of this data is still missing. This paper presents the design of a platform which transfers available enterprise data into a unified model for virtual training and thus enables virtual training of workers at the assembly line before the physical prototypes exist. The data requirements and constraints stemming from industrial partners involved in the project will be discussed. A second hurdle for virtual training is the insufficient user integration and acceptance. In this context, the paper introduces an innovative hardware set-up for game-based user interaction, which has been chosen to enhance user involvement and acceptance of virtual training.","","978-1-4673-2564-6","978-1-4673-2563-9","10.1109/VSMM.2012.6365944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365944","Data Integration;Industrial Training;PLM;User-Interaction;Virtual Reality","Assembly;Data models;Geometry;Hardware;Production;Solid modeling;Training","assembling;automobile industry;business data processing;computer based training;data integration;human factors;product design;virtual manufacturing;virtual reality","EU-FP7 project;VISTRA;assembly line;automotive industry;data integration;enterprise data;game-based user interaction;game-based virtual training system;manufacturing design;procedural assembly knowledge;product design;unified model;user acceptance;user integration;user involvement;virtual assembly training systems;virtual environments","","","","0","","12","","","20121203","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is useful to predict the suitability of the device under evaluation to the prescribed mission, as well as to improve the design of new generations of devices. An experimental technique is exploited in this paper to evaluate the stress exerted on planar power MOSFETs designed to equip automotive ABS systems. The technique is based on an accurate experimental analysis of electro-thermal cycles, exploiting a laboratory tool tailored around an infrared microscope. It enables an high resolution dynamic temperature mapping with a large bandwidth. Such a tool makes also possible the evaluation of the effects of charge trapping phenomena occurring on power MOSFETS as result of unavoidable gate overvoltages.

Although there is necessity for thourough testing, exhaustive validiation and verification is hardly possible in industry due to time and resource restrictions. In the past the reason for this has often been that it was to time-consuming to specify, to execute, and to evaluate test cases for the first design models and the integrated embedded system. In the meantime methods have become popular in industry that allow the automated generation, execution, and evaluation of test cases. In order to be able to automate these steps all necessary information must be integrated into the models that are the basis for the following steps. The complexity of the system, however, makes the evaluation and assessment of the behavior of the system even more complex. The growth of information needed for this comes along with it. The integration of this information into the model which is used for the generation of test cases is hardly feasible. In this paper we describe how this issue can be addressed by the combination of reference models in MATLAB/Simulink® with test models. Time Usage Models (TUM) are employed as test models and provide the basis to generate all possible test scenarios. Model based statistical testing with consideration of time and durations is supported by TUMs. The reference models are used like an executable specification, providing information for the evaluation of the system to be tested. The test model can therefore be kept generic in order to be able to derive virtually any test case from the model, taking account of the potentially infinite sequence of inputs reactive systems might process. We applied the presented approach with a german automotive OEM for the validation and verification of the energy management system.","","978-1-4577-1078-0","","10.1109/ICSEng.2011.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6041559","Design;Embedded Systems;Real-time Systems;Reliability;Road Vehicles;Safety Critical Systems;Simulation;Software Testing","Automotive engineering;Data models;Energy management;Real time systems;Testing;Unified modeling language","automatic test pattern generation;automatic test software;automobiles;automotive electronics;embedded systems;energy management systems;formal verification;safety-critical software;statistical testing","German automotive OEM;MATLAB/Simulink;automated test case evaluation;automated test case execution;automated test case generation;embedded system validiation;embedded system verification;energy management system;integrated embedded system;meantime method;real-time embedded automotive system modeling;reference model;resource restriction;road vehicle;statistical testing;test model;time restriction;time usage model","","","","2","","17","","","20111013","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, more and more vehicles, such as BMW X5, are connected from outside via smart phone[3]. From smart phone, users can use the internet resources in automotive. Also, from smart phone users can monitor the automotives. When the automotive is moving or stolen by robber, an alert information will be reported to users and users can even brake their automotive via smart phone in emergency status by sending control command to the vehicle information gateway. So a client software in smart phone is required to monitor the sensor network in automotives. And to prevent the client software is maliciously used by robbers, a security mechanism should be given for this client on the constraints of computation power, security level and power consumption. We proposed to encrypt all the messages in IDEA, which is with high security level and prone to implement in software and less demands on computation power. The critical data is suggested being stored in record management set, a mechanism based on Java MIDlet. And a communication transaction management is also proposed for SMS/MMS communication between the client software and its gateway.

Results show the effectiveness of the fault-tolerant semi-active damper versus an uncontrolled damper; the improvement is 50.4% in comfort and 42.4% in road holding, by avoiding biases in the damper deflection.","","978-1-4673-5198-0","978-1-4673-5199-7","10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548842","","","actuators;automotive engineering;design engineering;failure analysis;fault tolerance;road vehicles;robust control;shock absorbers;vibration control","CarSimTM;QoV model;actuator faults;automotive damper;automotive suspension system;compensation mechanism;damper deflection;external disturbances;failure effect reduction;fault tolerant control;fault tolerant semiactive damper;quarter of vehicle model;road holding;robust fault detection scheme;robust fault estimation scheme;robust linear parameter-varying controller;vertical dynamics;vibration isolation","","","","0","","10","","","20130627","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional development processes depend heavily on actual engine and vehicle testing, which means that control logic design can not start before the hardware is completed. And when performance is not sufficient, hardware and control design iteration is required. To shorten the development period, concurrent development of hardware and software is effective. Moreover, the control logic complexity is becoming higher in accordance with the implementation of new sensors, actuators, and improved control system performance. In turn, this increased complexity results in a huge control logic parameter calibration task. Various studies that use modeling to reduce calibration measurements have been tried. To expand MBD throughout our development process, we require that models are developed in a rapid and timely manner. In this paper, we discuss the concepts of MBD and concurrent development, and introduce some example applications. We also describe some key points for efficient model development.","","978-7-81124-055-9","978-7-900719-22-5","10.1109/CHICC.2006.4347173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4347173","Hardware-in-loop;Model based development","Automotive engineering;Calibration;Control design;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Engines;Hardware;Logic design;Logic testing;Vehicles","automotive engineering;concurrent engineering;engines;formal specification","concurrent development;control logic complexity;control logic design;control logic parameter calibration;control system development;engine development;model based development","","","","0","","8","","","20071015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is also true for communication schedule synthesis where key decisions are taken early because of interactions with the suppliers. The possibility of change necessitates a design process that can analyze schedules for robustness to uncertainties, e.g., changes in estimated task durations or communication load. A robust design would be able to accommodate these changes incrementally without changes in the system scheduling, thus reducing validation times and increasing reusability. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the info-gap decision theory that provides a systematic scheme for analyzing robustness of schedules by computing the greatest horizon of uncertainty that still satisfies the performance requirements. The paper formulates info-gap models for potential uncertainties in schedule synthesis for a distributed automotive system communicating over a FlexRay network, and shows their application to a case study.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457146","","Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Decision theory;Network synthesis;Performance analysis;Process design;Processor scheduling;Robustness;Sensitivity analysis;Uncertainty","automotive electronics;decision theory","EE architecture design;FlexRay network;FlexRay schedule robustness;automotive EE system;communication schedule synthesis;distributed automotive system;in-vehicle requirement;info-gap decision theory","","","","1","","12","","","20100429","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is from the lowest level where physics of failure describes the process for fatigue crack initiation and development within the material microstructure to the complex electronic interconnect, the electronic control unit (ECU), and finally to the overall vehicle system of ECUs. The oversimplification that every element within the system of ECUs has a constant failure rate is not assumed. In fact, no assumptions are made about failure rates. Physics of failure models are used to predict failure rates based on measured statistical variations. With the advent of the computer, the understanding of the physics of failure and how to apply it directly to electronics design has greatly improved. The vast array of computer aided design and manufacturing tools now in existence has enabled the simulation of physics for thermodynamics, fluid flow and structural analysis for example. Statistical measurements of manufacturing process control determine the statistical variations in the geometric dimensions and product material properties. Warranty records, customer surveys and built-in diagnostics are used to determine the statistical variation is how the product is used. These statistical distributions are combined with the physics of failure within VEXTEC's virtual representation of the electronics product to simulate the product's real world performance. Thus, reliability can be estimated while the product is still on the drawing board. This paper will discuss the various aspects that make up this new electronics design framework.

Some mechanisms ruling the engine and the combustion process are in fact unknown and/or show hard nonlinearities. These difficulties limit the effectiveness of traditional control approaches. In this paper, we suggest a neural based solution to the air-to-fuel ratio control in fuel injection systems. An indirect control approach has been considered which requires a preliminary modeling of the engine dynamics. The model for the engine and the final controller are based on recurrent neural networks with external feedbacks.

The DVR model makes use of a cybernetic driver model to take into account any driver–vehicle interactions. Such a formulation allows 1) considering driver assistance cooperation criteria in the control synthesis, 2) improving the performance of the assistance as a cooperative copilot, and 3) analyzing the stability of the whole system in the presence of driver model uncertainty. The results have been experimentally validated with one participant using a fixed-base driving simulator. The developed assistance system improved lane-keeping performance and reduced the risk of a lane departure accident. Good results were obtained using several criteria for human–machine cooperation. Poor stability situations were successfully avoided due to the robustness of the whole system, in spite of a large range of driver model uncertainty.","1524-9050","","","10.1109/TITS.2013.2248363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6482261","Driver model;H2-Preview;lane keeping;shared steering control;vehicle lateral control","Automation;Cybernetics;Roads;Stability analysis;Torque;Vehicles;Wheels","","","","","","0","","34","","2013-03-19","20130529","","IEEE","IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To close the gap between raising complexity and cutting costs, upcoming software standards like AUTOSAR introduce a clear separation of concerns into their system architecture. An AUTOSAR application is built from components that deal with business logic only whereas infrastructural services are provided by standardized middleware. Unfortunately, this middleware tends to be heavy-weight due to its coarse-grained layered design. By applying a component based design to AUTOSAR's middleware, a custom-tailored version for each specific application and system node can be built to overcome this problem. This paper demonstrates how to automatically synthesize component based middleware via the connector transformation: component connectors in platform independent application models are utilized to automatically assemble platform- and application specific middleware. As a result, AUTOSAR middleware becomes custom-tailored and hence light-weight and flexible. In addition, the described synthesis algorithm is capable of incorporating timing annotations via interface contracts at model level, and thus reflects upcoming ambitions to cover real-time constraints at middleware level within AUTOSAR. To prove our approach we successfully synthesized middleware for a demonstrator application and compared it to its conventional counterpart.","1555-0885","978-0-7695-3573-9","","10.1109/ISORC.2009.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5231999","AUTOSAR;CBSE;MDD;Middleware;Model Transformation;Synthesis","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Connectors;Costs;Embedded system;Manufacturing;Middleware;Real time systems;Software standards","automobile industry;automotive engineering;embedded systems;middleware;object-oriented programming;software architecture","AUTOSAR basic software;business logic;coarse-grained layered design;component based middleware-synthesis;connector transformation;distributed real-time automotive embedded system","","","","0","","20","","","20090904","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Low cost fcCSP based on cu pillar","Appelt, B.K.; Chung, H.; Chienfan Chen; Wang, R.; Hung, M.","ASE Group Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA","Electronics Packaging Technology Conference (EPTC), 2011 IEEE 13th","7-9 Dec. 2011","2011","","","236","239","Flip chip (fc) packaging has been practiced for many years but mainly for high end computer and certain automotive devices. RoHS has driven the conversion from lead-based fc bumps to lead-free (Pb-free) bumps. Pb-free was adopted more readily in consumer and mobile applications than in high reliability applications. A few years back, Intel introduced copper pillars (CuP) as an alternative to high Pb bumps to minimize electro-migration which was found at high currents in high performance applications. CuP was used in conjunction with Pb-free solder thereby achieving compliance with RoHS while at the same time improving reliability with superior electro-migration and thermal performance. Now, mobile applications are adopting CuP but primarily for fine pitch applications. CuPs are invariant in height and diameter during reflow unlike solder bumps which were also termed controlled chip collapse connections (C4). C4s have the advantage of self-aligning during solder reflow i.e. placement accuracy does not have to be extremely precise. With the advent of high precision die bonders, die with CuPs and small solder caps can be placed sufficiently accurate to enable mass reflow connections. CuPs do enable other significant advantages which do enable significant cost reductions. The fixed diameter of the pillars provides a larger pillar to pillar spacing as compared solder bumps at the same pitch and stand-off. The larger spacing which avoids any shorting concerns also potentially allows additional traces between bumps/pillars, thereby increasing the routability. Or alternatively, wider traces/spaces can be employed in the substrate design which equates to simpler substrate processes albeit lower substrate costs. The higher stand-off facilitates mold-only underfill processing which is also a significant process simplification i.e. cost reduction. Of course CuPs also present new challenges due to the very high stiffness, especially when assembled to lowK or ELK dies. Finite El- ment Modeling (FEM) has provided successful guidelines to overcome the stress induced damage that had been observed initially. Here, the advantages of CuP based fcCSP packaging will be detailed with design rules for pillars and substrates to achieve cost reductions. Further, FEM results and design guides for die CuP bumping will be given and substantiated by stress test results. Finally, a roadmap for CuP-fcCSP will be presented.","","978-1-4577-1983-7","978-1-4577-1981-3","10.1109/EPTC.2011.6184423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184423","","Bonding;Copper;Encapsulation;Finite element methods;Nickel;Reliability;Substrates","copper;electronics packaging;flip-chip devices;solders","automotive device;controlled chip collapse connections;copper pillars;cost reduction;design rules;electro-migration;finite element modeling;flip chip packaging;high precision die bonders;lead-based flip chip bumps;lead-free bumps;mass reflow connection;mobile application;pillar spacing;placement accuracy;process simplification;routability;small solder caps;solder bumps;solder reflow;stress test;substrate design;thermal performance;underfill processing","","","","0","","9","","","20120419","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The time delay in the estimated motions from one wheelset to the other is detected by the means of cross-correlation calculations. The development of the proposed technique is detailed, and the design of an inverse model for the estimation of wheelset motions is presented. The performance of the measurement method is evaluated based on a comprehensive vehicle model using one of the standard multibody simulation packages widely used by vehicle manufacturers and compared with the International Union of Railways (UIC) requirement for wheel slide protection. There is no need to use conventional position encoders, and therefore, difficulties associated with inaccuracy in wheel slip/slide conditions or limited resolutions of the encoders are eliminated.

While this approach, also known as model-based design, is becoming quite standard for several domains that have similar constraints as wireless sensor networks, such as automotive electronics, there is a lack of tools for this purpose in the WSN world.

In this paper, a new FDI scheme is developed for automotive engines under closed-loop control system. Test the method using closed-loop system has been done. The method uses an independent radial basis function (RBF) neural network model to model engine dynamics, and the modeling errors are used to form the basis for residual generation. Furthermore, another RBF network is used as a fault classifier to isolate occurred fault from other possible faults in the system. The performance of the developed scheme is assessed using an engine benchmark, the Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) with Matlab/Simulink. Six faults have been simulated on the MVEM, including four sensor faults, one component fault and one actuator fault. The simulation results show that all the simulated faults can be clearly detected and isolated in dynamic conditions throughout the engine operating range.","","978-1-4673-1559-3","978-1-4673-1558-6","10.1109/CONTROL.2012.6334669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6334669","Automotive engines under closed-loop control;RBF neural network;fault detection;fault isolation;independent RBF model","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Automotive engineering;Clocks;FAA;Fuels","automotive engineering;closed loop systems;fault diagnosis;internal combustion engines;open loop systems;radial basis function networks","FDI scheme;automobile design;automotive engine;closed-loop control system;closed-loop system;engine dynamics;engine open loop system;fault detection;fault isolation;independent radial basis function neural network model;mean value engine model;modeling errors;residual generation","","","","0","","6","","","20121022","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the system has to function correctly in the presence of sensor faults, event-triggered task activation is not reliable. Faulty sensors may cause task activations to occur too early, too late, or task activations are omitted entirely. In particular, early task activations can overload the system. Time-triggered task activation is reliable, but by defining a competitiveness ratio it is shown that the processor utilization for highly responsive tasks is unacceptably low. To overcome the problems of event-triggered task activation while preserving its good performance the task-splitting model is introduced. The task-splitting model integrates fault tolerance into the analysis and construction of hard real-time systems by using a combination of event-triggered and time-triggered task activation.

Adaptive critic designs are defined as designs that approximate dynamic programming in the general case, i.e., approximate optimal control over time in noisy, nonlinear environment. The goals of the present learning control design for automotive engines include improved performance, reduced emissions, and maintained optimum performance under various operating conditions. Using the data obtained from a test vehicle, we first develop a neural network model of the engine. The neural network controller is then designed based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control. In the simulation studies, the initial controller is trained using the neural network engine model developed rather than the actual engine. We have developed and tested self-learning neural network controllers for both engine torque and exhaust air-fuel ratio control. The goal of the engine torque control is to track the commanded torque. The objective of the air-fuel ratio control is to regulate the engine air-fuel ratio at specified set points. For both control problems, good transient performance of the neural network controller has been observed. A distinct feature of the present technique is the controller's real-time adaptation capability which allows the neural network controller to be further refined and improved in real-time vehicle operation through continuous learning and adaptation.","2158-9860","0-7803-8635-3","","10.1109/ISIC.2004.1387711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387711","","Adaptive control;Adaptive systems;Automotive engineering;Dynamic programming;Engines;Neural networks;Optimal control;Programmable control;Torque control;Vehicles","adaptive control;automobiles;control system synthesis;dynamic programming;fuel systems;learning systems;neurocontrollers;torque control","action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming;adaptive critic control;approximate optimal control;automotive fuel-injection systems;engine torque control;exhaust air-fuel ratio control;learning control design;neural network controller;neural network modeling","","","","5","","","","","20050131","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Electric power steering system (EPS) can improve vehicle handling performance and economy, has become one of hot spots on research and development in modern automobile steering system. Worm gears are important components of the electric power steering system; its transmission efficiency shall affect directly transmission efficiency and reset ability of the electric power steering system. Therefore, it is very important to adopt optimization methods to design the electric power steering systems. The fuzzy optimization model is established to design EPS. The method of second-class comprehensive evaluation was used by the optimal level cut set, thus the fuzzy optimization is transformed into the conventional optimization. This drawback of the genetic algorithm can be overcome by combining it with local gradient-based algorithms, which are known for their faster convergence. This hybrid approach improves the efficiency of the algorithm and also avoids the need to specify a good initial point for the derivative-based methods. A hybrid algorithm combining the genetic algorithm and local algorithm are developed in this paper, and the genetic algorithm can be combined with fuzzy logic to efficiently find a more accurate solution.","","978-1-4244-5585-0","978-1-4244-5586-7","10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5451666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451666","electric power steering system;fuzzy logic;intelligent optimization;test bench","Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Design methodology;Gears;Genetic algorithms;Intelligent vehicles;Optimization methods;Research and development;Steering systems;Testing","automobiles;electric vehicles;fuzzy logic;gears;genetic algorithms;steering systems","automotive steering system;electric power steering device;fuzzy logic;fuzzy optimization model;genetic algorithm;intelligent optimization;second-class comprehensive evaluation;test bench;vehicle handling economy;vehicle handling performance;worm gears","","","","1","","6","","","20100419","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

With limited hardware options and to justify the system design rationale, it is necessary to formulate a fault hypothesis to bound failure assumptions. The system must be built on a foundation of real-world relevance and the assumption of coverage of the fault hypothesis. This paper discusses a study that examines the sensitivity of a BRAIN (braided ring availability integrity network) design to different fault types and failure rates in a safety-relevant application. It presents a Markov-based model (using ASSIST, SURE, and STEM analysis tools) and a series of experiments that were run to analyze the overall dependability of the BRAIN approach. The study evaluates the mission reliability and safety in the context of a hypothetical automotive integrated x-by-wire architecture on top of the BRAIN. Drawing from experience in the aerospace domain, the authors investigate the possibility of continued operation for a limited period after a detected critical electronic failure.

In more general scenarios, where movements of other vehicles have to be tracked in all possible directions and all around the vehicle (e.g. in inner-city or intersection situations), the modeling is insufficient.

The transmitter contains a vertical-cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) operating at 850nm wavelength, an electronics driver chip, and some passive components. The package is a low cost leadframe style for through-hole or surface mounting (SMT). The SMT fiber optic transmitter is compatible with a reflow soldering process in an infra-red oven of 250degC peak temperature. With a specially designed heat shield the prototype shows a stable optical alignment performance before and after the reflow soldering. The output power of the transmitter is limited to 0.7mW to meet eye-safety class I requirements. The transmitter has an integrated coupling optics to provide loose alignment tolerances of plusmn70 mum in lateral axis for a working distance of 500mum to PCS optical fibers. The optical coupling power from the transmitter to the PCS fiber has a variation within 1dB over the wide ambient temperature range from -40degC to +105degC. This enables the usage of very low cost plastic molded connector ferrules. The receiver module contains a high speed MSM photodetector. The special design of the MSM photodetector enables high speed operation up to 3.2Gb/s in combination with a large active area for easy alignment. With two pairs of the fiber optic modules, we demonstrate a 1Gb/s video transmission over up to 15m of polymer cladded silica (PCS) optical fiber. The video link consists of a camera with an electrical S800 LVDS interface and a high resolution monitor. A pair of fiber optic cable connects the two ports replacing and extending the regular electrical cable. In contrast to the electrical cable the optical fiber is thin, light weight, and highly flexible. The high power budget margin of the link allows three in-line connectors for the 10-15m link length. For other applications a longer link length is feasible using higher bandwidth optical fiber. The VCSEL b- - ased fiber optic transmitter module has passed 3000 hours of high temperature operating life test at an operating ambient temperature of +105degC. The FOTs have also passed 1000 cycles of temperature cycling from -40degC to +125degC according to automotive requirements. The modules have passed electrostatic discharge tests at levels up to plusmn4000V under human body model and plusmn400V for machine model with no significant change in optical output power.

Many firms have responded to this pressure by setting goals of reducing new product development (NPD) cycle time and/or improving product performance, often by setting up fuzzy gates between stages, cross-functional teams, or both. This study examines the tradeoff between product performance and time to market, focusing on the effect of overlapping stages during which marketing, design, and manufacturing engineering are jointly working on performance improvement, An NPD process model comprising a design stage, a process stage, and an intermediary overlap stage representing the interaction between design and process personnel is developed. Key findings include the following. (1) Overlapping stages reduces time to market, but the marginal returns to lengthening the overlap stage yield progressively smaller improvements in time to market. (2) The longer the market window is open, the less is the pressure to rush the product to market, and product performance can be further improved by leaving the product longer in development. (3) It is better to keep the product longer in development rather than accelerate time to market if the base product performance is low. (4) If the productivity of the overlap stage is increased, it is more profitable to keep the product in development longer and boost product performance at launch than to rush the product to market quicker. (5) The greater the market power the firm possesses, the faster it should bring the product to market, as long as product performance and sustainability of market power are not substantially reduced. A set of propositions is derived from the model, and is tested in a small-scale empirical study on firms in the automobile and automotive supply industry. The results are largely supportive of the propositions.

The problem involved with the estimation of the local model parameters of neurofuzzy networks is the presence of noise in measured data. When some or all input channels are subject to noise, the GTLS algorithm yields consistent parameter estimates. In addition to the estimation of the parameters, the main challenge in the design of these local model networks is the determination of the region of validity for the local models. The method presented in this paper is based on an expectation-maximization algorithm that uses a residual from the GTLS parameter estimation for proper partitioning. The performance of the resulting nonlinear model with local parameters estimated by weighted GTLS is a product both of the parameter estimation itself and the associated residual used for the partitioning process.

In this article a new parametrization for estimating the peak friction coefficient, in the tire-road interface, is presented. The proposed parametrization is based on a feedforward neural network (FFNN), trained by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method. Unlike traditional learning techniques for FFNN, typically based on backpropagation and inappropriate for real time implementation, the ELM provides a learning process based on random assignment in the weights between input and the hidden layer. With this approach, the network training becomes much faster, and the unknown parameters can be identified through simple and robust regression methods, such as the Recursive Least Squares. Simulation results, obtained with the CarSim program, demonstrate a good performance of the proposed parametrization; compared with previous methods described in the literature, the proposed method reduces the estimation errors using a model with a lower number of parameters.","","978-1-4244-8220-7","","10.1109/VPPC.2010.5729138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5729138","","Approximation methods;Estimation error;Friction;Roads;Tires;Vehicles","adhesion;automotive engineering;backpropagation;feedforward neural nets;friction;least squares approximations;mechanical engineering computing;regression analysis;road safety;roads;tyres;vehicle dynamics","CarSim program;automotive applications;backpropagation technique;extreme learning machine method;feedforward neural network;linear parametrization;peak friction coefficient estimation;recursive least squares method;regression methods;tire-road interface;vehicle safety systems","","","","0","","20","","","20110310","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research and industry have investigated the issue, how to derive test cases to cover test requirements within minimal time. For the automation of all activities related to testing tool support is available. Yet, one question is getting increasingly difficult: How to derive good, i.e. significant test cases, embracing requirements from an external perspective and incorporating knowledge about the internal design and architecture of the system under test (SUT). In this paper we present the use of internal dependences and implementation metrics in combination with an exterior view on the basis of requirements with the aim to profile the test model for the generation of good, i.e. significant test cases. The incorporation of different sources of knowledge of the SUT into test generation reduces the effort to determine test cases for different test goals independently while recreating the knowledge of the SUT in each test process step. We applied the method to a real implementation of automotive functionality in the thermal control unit of a German OEM, that was designed in Matlab Simulink and architectured in AUTOSAR 3.2. The existing test suites were linked with the internal dependences of the Matlab Code, as to assess the reachability of the existing test cases already on the implementation model. In a next step, model metrics were calculated for the implementation modules. They were set into relation with the test cases and code coverage. In doing so, we profiled the test cases and assessed the significance and expressiveness of the model metrics.","","","","10.1109/SIES.2013.6601492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601492","AUTOSAR;Centrality;Component-Dependency-Model;Cyclomatic Complexity;Matlab;Metrics;Simulink;Test Profiling;Thermal Control System;Usage Model","Analytical models;Complexity theory;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Measurement;Testing","automatic test software;automotive engineering;embedded systems;program testing;software architecture;software metrics","AUTOSAR 3.2;German OEM;Matlab Code;Matlab Simulink;SUT architecture;SUT design;automotive functionality;complex multiple functionality devices;component dependency models;embedded systems;implementation metrics;internal dependences;model metrics;system under test;test case determination;test case reachability;test generation;test model;test profiling;test requirements;testing tool support;thermal control unit;usage models","","","","0","","22","","","20130919","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

More recently, Variable Geometry Compressors (VGC) systems are being considered as a further improvement of automotive turbochargers for their potential of providing a more direct control over the stability margin and the efficiency of the compressor. In particular, a direct control on the stability margin allows to size the compressor more aggressively to obtain better peak performances. When such an aggressive design is adopted the control of the VGC to prevent surging becomes essential and a reliable Surge Index (SI) estimator needs to be included in the control algorithm. This paper presents two estimator designs for an automotive Diesel engine equipped with a variable geometry compressor. The estimators aim at tracking the value of two important performance variables, namely the Surge Index and the compressor efficiency. The first estimator design relies on an open-loop scheme that is based on the analytical inversion of a grey-box model for the prediction of the compressor flow and efficiency maps. The second estimator is a Kalman filter observer that allows to improve estimation performances when sensor measurements are corrupted by noise. Simulation results are provided in steady-state and transient conditions to verify the accuracy and robustness of the estimators and compare their performances.","0743-1619","978-1-4799-0177-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6580651","","Atmospheric modeling;Engines;Equations;Indexes;Mathematical model;Observers;Surges","Kalman filters;compressors;diesel engines;open loop systems;robust control;stability;surges","Kalman filter;SI estimator;VGC system;Variable geometry turbocharger;automotive diesel engine;compressor efficiency estimation;compressor flow;direct control;energy recovery;grey-box model;open-loop scheme;sensor measurement;surge index;transient condition;variable geometry compressor system","","","","0","","21","","","20130815","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A torque-level control law is first designed using robust backstepping. The backstepping proceeds via the force and the velocity states. The voltage-level control laws are obtained from the virtual control law for the torque using either an additional step of backstepping incorporating a novel voltage-commutation scheme or a torque-ripple-minimizing algorithm based on a design of turn-on/turn-off angles and torque factors. The controllers do not require knowledge of the motor mechanical parameters and the functional forms of the relationships among the motor position, the brake force, and the motor load torque. A detailed model of the motor including current-dependent inductance coefficients is used. The load exerted on the motor by the caliper may be modeled as a spring; however, the actual load model is taken to be an unknown nonlinear function of position to allow for uncertainties in the model. Hence, the developed controllers work for a wide variety of loads including brake systems. Moreover, the controllers provide significant robustness to uncertainty in the inductances and address practical current and voltage constraints. The performance of the proposed controllers is demonstrated through both simulation and experimental studies.","1063-6536","","","10.1109/TCST.2008.2006908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815389","Braking;electromechanical brake;force control;road vehicles;switched reluctance motor (SRM)","","automobiles;automotive components;brakes;force control;nonlinear control systems;reluctance motors;robust control;torque control;voltage control","automotive industry;current-dependent inductance coefficients;robust backstepping;robust nonlinear force controllers;switched-reluctance-motor electromechanical brake system;torque-level control law;torque-ripple-minimizing algorithm;virtual control law;voltage-commutation scheme;voltage-level control law","","","","5","1","36","","2009-04-17","20091023","","IEEE","IEEE Control Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An ETC control system consists of a DC servo motor driving a circular-shaped valve plate, which is connected to a preloaded spring. The opening angle of the valve plate controls the air flow into the engine. When the control system fails, the spring can keep the valve at a pre-defined angle, i.e. the limp-home position, in order to provide the necessary air flow to keep the engine running. The ETC is commanded by the engine control unit (ECU) to achieve economic fuel consumption and the required performance. The spring in the ETC unit exhibits a piecewise linear torque-displacement relationship due to the preload. The stiffness around the limp-home position is much higher than that in other area in order to withstand the vacuum pressure in the engine cylinder. There are two major nonlinear effects in an ETC system: one is the nonlinear torque-displacement relation resulted from the preloaded spring; and the other is the friction force between the valve plate and the manifold. In order to improve the performance of the current ETC system, we develop a mathematic model for the spring-loaded ETC system and adopt a closed-loop identification approach to obtain the nonlinear displacement-torque function in the complete working range. To design the servo control system for the ETC, we analyze the nonlinear spring effect on the ETC system robustness, and found that a control design based on the low spring constant area is robust even when the spring constant becomes ten times larger around the limp-home position. We design and implement a two-degree-of-freedom control system, the experiment results show very good command response regardless the preload spring effect and excellent disturbance rejection performance against the friction force.","1943-6572","978-1-4244-6668-9","978-1-4244-6669-6","10.1109/AMC.2010.5464020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464020","","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Engines;Friction;Robust control;Servomechanisms;Servosystems;Springs;Torque control;Valves","closed loop systems;displacement control;engines;friction;nonlinear control systems;road vehicles;servomechanisms;springs (mechanical);torque control;traction;valves","circular-shaped valve plate;closed-loop identification approach;economic fuel consumption;electronic throttle valve;engine control unit;engine torque control;friction force;limp-home position;modern automotive;nonlinear spring effect;nonlinear torque-displacement relation;servo control design;traction control","","","","1","1","9","","","20100513","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analysis is carried out by characterizing separately both the system and the user's needs in terms of quantitative attributes of performance. These attributes are determined as functions of primitives (independent design variables) that describe the automotive system, the user's requirements, and their context. System capabilities and requirements are compared in a common attribute space by means of a geometric locus, on which certain partial measures of effectiveness can be computed. These partial measures are then combined to yield an overall effectiveness measure for studying design tradeoffs. The methodology is illustrated by assessing the effectiveness of a diesel powered passenger car with respect to fuel economy and emissions in the context of a simplified E.P.A. drive cycle. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to integrate complex data bases derived from simulation, laboratory test and analytical models as often found in automotive design.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4788843","","Analytical models;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Engines;Fuels;Information analysis;Performance analysis;Propulsion;Research and development;System performance","","","","","","0","","6","","","20090310","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a novel approach to verify embedded software running on a microprocessor model, based on a coverage driven verification technique. We have combined a new application called generic software adapter with a SystemC PowerPC microprocessor model in order to cover difficult corner case scenarios in embedded software.

On real highways, however, the performance of the ABS-equipped car has been disappointing. The poor braking performance with ABS has resulted from the questionable design of the human-machine interface for the brake system. The goal of this study is to design brake systems that provide more intuitive brake control and proper braking-performance information for the driver. In this study automotive brake systems are modeled as a type of master-slave telemanipulator. Human force-displacement interaction at the brake pedal has a strong effect on braking performance. As a preliminary study in brake-system design, the characteristics of human leg motion and its underlying motor-control scheme are studied through experiments and simulations, and a model of braking motion by the driver's leg is developed. This paper proposes novel brake systems based on two new aspects. First, the mechanical impedance characteristics of the leg action of the driver are taken into consideration in designing the brake systems. Second, the brake systems provide the driver with kinesthetic feedback of braking conditions or performance. The effectiveness of the proposed designs in a combined driver-vehicle system is investigated using driving simulation.","1083-4427","","","10.1109/TSMCA.2004.832813","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1325326","Brake system;braking motion;human motor control;teleoperator","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Electronic components;Electronic equipment testing;Humans;Leg;Man machine systems;Road transportation;System testing;Vehicles","adaptive control;braking;feedback;kinematics;motion control;road vehicles;telecontrol","antilock brake system technology;automotive brake system;braking-performance information;human force-displacement interaction;human leg motion;human motor control scheme;human-machine interface;kinesthetic feedback;master-slave telemanipulator;mechanical impedance characteristics","","","","9","","30","","","20040824","","IEEE","IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For automotive applications, standards call for high levels of operation stability, reportedly 5,500 hours for cars and over 20,000 hours for buses. In addition to durability, membranes should also meet a certain price target for fuel cells to be competitive with incumbent gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines. A techno-economic analysis has been performed to explore different membrane designs which are proposed to enhance durability. For this reason, a cost analysis platform has been created. The technical-economic cost model (TCM) developed depicts how the production cost per unit varies depending on the different fabrication methods, production rate limitations, material selection, labor distribution, energy consumption, financial parameters and the target production volume. This platform enables the efficient exploration of each potential design solution and identification of the key factors for each design. By using such an approach in the design, research time and resources can be saved by prioritizing R&D and production scale-up options at an early stage. Using our cost analysis platform, we explored the effect of material cost on the overall production cost for PEMs based on NAFION<sup>®</sup>; the effect of additive on the overall cost is minor especially when the production process is unchanged. Comparing the results to existing market standards, we found that current industry standard assumptions are intended for conservative investment.","","978-1-4673-2853-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6304312","","Assembly;Diffusion tensor imaging;Fuel cells;Industries;Materials;Production","automotive electrics;costing;energy consumption;proton exchange membrane fuel cells","NAFION;PEM fuel cell life time;TCM;automotive applications;cost analysis;durable proton exchange membrane;energy consumption;fabrication methods;financial parameters;industry standard;labor distribution;market standards;material cost;material selection;production cost;production process;production rate limitations;target production volume;technical-economic cost model","","","","0","","11","","","20120917","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the thermal analysis is now essential for peak and thermal cycle amplitudes prediction which are the main driving factors for equipment reliability. The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Software is becoming increasingly common to perform this kind of analysis. Unfortunately, when quick response is needed to trade off between several design solutions, when complex power profiles have to be addressed or when non linear effects of temperature have to be considered in power loss prediction (electro-thermal simulation), the CFD solution is sometimes of little help. The paper describes a methodology which allows to perform a thermal analysis in a reduced time. Simulation time reduction is based on simplification of the thermal model by focusing analysis on a reduced number of points (power injection points and observed temperatures). 3D model using millions of cells is converted into a “0D” or “mesh less” model using a few tens of points.","","978-1-61284-814-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730668","","Analytical models;Computational fluid dynamics;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;SPICE;Temperature sensors;Transfer functions","automobile industry;automotive electronics;hybrid electric vehicles;reliability;road safety;thermal analysis","3D model;CFD software;automotive industry;computational fluid dynamics;embedded electronic functions;equipment reliability;fuel consumption reduction;hybrid or electrical vehicles;nonlinear temperature effects;power loss prediction;road car safety;simulation time reduction;thermal cycle amplitude prediction;thermal model analysis;thermal power dissipation;thermal pre-dimensioning methodology","","","","0","","4","","","20110314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Model-based techniques help to address this issue by enabling automated transformation between different design models, and providing means for simulation and verification. We present a way of integrating architectural models and verification techniques, which has been implemented in a tool called ViTAL. Consequently, ViTAL provides the possibility to express the functional EAST-ADL behavior as timed automata models, which have precise semantics and can be formally verified. The ViTAL tool enables the transformation of EASTADL functional models to the UPPAAL PORT tool for model checking. This method improves the verification of functional and timing requirements in EAST-ADL, and makes it possible to identify dependencies and potential conflicts between different vehicle functions before the actual AUTOSAR implementation.","","978-1-4673-2156-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6299228","model-based techniques; verification; analysis; UPPAAL PORT; EAST-ADL; Model transformation;","Analytical models;Automata;FAA;Semantics;Timing;Unified modeling language","automata theory;automotive engineering;formal verification;mechanical engineering computing;software architecture","AUTOSAR;EASTADL functional models;UPPAAL PORT tool;ViTAL;architectural models;architecture description language;automotive embedded system design;functional modeling;model checking;model-based techniques;model-driven development;structural modeling;systems architecture;timed automata models;verification tool","","","","1","","","","","20120913","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mathematical models are constructed for the system. Based on the analysis and simulation of the dynamic model, the dynamometer is decoupled into two subsystems. For the power output control subsystem, a nonlinear tracking controller based on feedback linearization and internal model principle is designed; for the operating pressure control subsystem, a PID regulator is designed. Simulation results in AMESim environment demonstrate the fast dynamic response and precise tracking capability of the proposed control system.","0743-1619","978-1-4244-4523-3","978-1-4244-4524-0","10.1109/ACC.2009.5160567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5160567","","Automotive engineering;Fuels;Linear feedback control systems;Mechanical power transmission;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Power system modeling;Pressure control;Research and development;Torque control;Vehicle dynamics","dynamometers;feedback;linearisation techniques;nonlinear control systems;position control;power control;pressure control;three-term control","AMESim environment;PID regulator;automotive powertrain;electromagnetic dynamometers;feedback linearization;fuel consumption;hydrostatic dynamometer;next generation transient dynamometers;nonlinear tracking controller;power density;power output control subsystem;pressure control","","","","1","","10","","","20090710","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, higher combustion temperature in diesel engines cause substantially larger percentage of nitrogen oxides (NOχ) emissions. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a well proven technology for reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from automotive sources and in particular, heavy-duty diesel engines. In this paper, we develop a quasi linear parameter varying (qLPV) model to capture the non-linearities in the dynamics of the ammonia SCR system with varying catalyst surface temperature. To effectively enable the use of LMI-based control design methods, the number of LPV parameters in the qLPV model is then reduced by using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique. An LPV feedback/feedforward controller is designed for the qLPV model with reduced number of scheduling parameters. The designed full-order controller is further simplified to a first-order transfer function with parameter-varying gain and pole. Finally, simulation results illustrate the high conversion efficiency with minimum ammonia slip of the closed-loop SCR system using the parameter-varying control law.","0743-1619","978-1-4577-0080-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5991102","","Control design;Feedforward neural networks;Mathematical model;Output feedback;Principal component analysis;Temperature control;Thyristors","closed loop systems;diesel engines;feedforward;linear matrix inequalities;linear systems;principal component analysis;temperature control","LMI based control design;NOχ;PCA based linear parameter varying control;SCR;SCR aftertreatment systems;automotive sources;carbon monoxide;closed-loop system;combustion temperature;diesel engines;feedback controller;feedforward controller;gasoline engines;hydrocarbons;nitrogen oxides;polluting emissions;principal component analysis;qLPV;quasi linear parameter varying model;selective catalytic reduction","","","","2","","14","","","20110818","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flip chip assemblies prior to underfilling are particularly vulnerable to stresses induced in the solder bumps due to the absence of a protective underfill layer. While excessive board flexure during manufacturing can be controlled, it cannot be completely eliminated. The need therefore arises to evaluate the vulnerability of any given flip chip assembly to board flexure. In addition, it may be necessary to optimize flip chip assembly design early in the design cycle to ensure robustness during manufacturing. To achieve these objectives, flexure experiments have been conducted on various types of flip chips mounted on test boards in order to quantify the board flexure limit for each assembly. Utilizing these test results, a computer model has been developed for the purpose of simulating the effect of circuit board flexure on flip chip assemblies before the underfill process. Comparison of simulation results with experimental test data from flip chip flexure testing show excellent correlation. Simulations have been conducted for numerous flip chips intended for use in high volume production at Delphi Automotive Systems.

This contrasts with rapid prototyping that typically uses much more powerful hardware than will be used in production. Rapid prototyping allows the designer to evaluate the functional behaviour of embedded software, however, it does not ensure that the final product will satisfy the performance requirements on a resource constrained, mass production embedded microprocessor. By contrast, on-target rapid prototyping additionally allows an assessment of how the automatically generated code will perform on final production hardware. On-target rapid prototyping is being widely adopted in today's automotive and aerospace development processes. The primary technology that enables this is Model-Based Design with automatic production code generation. This session introduces on-target rapid prototyping. It will also discuss modelling and code generation guidelines that help developers transition smoothly from traditional rapid-prototyping to on-target rapid prototyping.

The Virtual Integration methodology is an approach to detect and to solve compatibility issues during early stages of system design. The methodology supports developers with a set of measures to reduce the risk of incompatibilities to a minimum at each abstraction layer of their system architecture. Realtime requirements of embedded systems make it necessary to support the methodology with a formal model, which can describe dynamic properties of these systems.

They are a composite of an element or alloy metal bound into a `matrix' structure, formed by a reaction synthesis process. The most common material combinations are aluminum (Al) and silicon carbide (SiC). Because of their composite nature, the properties of MMCs can be tailored to suit the particular application based on the contribution of individual materials. Current applications find them in automotive, aircraft brake rotors and space electronic packaging, where toughness and dimensional stability at temperature extremes are important. Several silicon-carbide particulate (p) reinforced aluminium (SiC/Al) and graphite/ aluminium (Gr/Al), electronic packages have been space-qualified and are now flown on communication satellites and Global Positioning System satellites. The most significant problem in the space power electronic module concept is the issue of adequate thermal management and consequent electrical performance. It is believed that a Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) heat spreader, with high thermal conductivity and low CTE has the potential to solve many of these thermal management issues. Applied to electronics cooling applications, the primary advantage of MMCs is the ability to tailor the CTE to match bonded and mating materials, such as copper, braze material, ceramic substrates, and silicon in one hand and in other hand as the electronics devices get smaller and smaller, self-heating becomes important and changes the electronic performance of device. This thermal-electronic coupling effect often results in thermal runaway and hence the breakdown of the device. In this paper, an investigation of the thermal behavior of space electronics devices using a Metal Matrix Composite Materials, using the Transmission -Line-Matrix (TLM) method, is exposed. The technique has be- n successful in modeling various heat diffusion and mass transport problems and has proven to be efficient in terms of stability, complex geometries and the incorporation of non linear material properties. The three dimensional results show that the method has a considerable potential in small devices thermal analysis and design. The results show that the development of MMCs for use in the Space Electronics Systems thermal design is quite promising considering the superior thermal characteristics.","","978-1-4673-6395-2","","10.1109/RAST.2013.6581254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6581254","3D-TLM;CTE;Ceramic;Conduction;Heat dissipation;Heat spreader;MMC materials;Nodes;Power electronics;Thermal Management","Aerospace electronics;Heating;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Materials;Mathematical model;Thermal conductivity;Time-varying systems","Global Positioning System;aerospace industry;aerospace materials;aluminium;cooling;graphite;particle reinforced composites;rotors;satellite communication;silicon compounds;space vehicle electronics;thermal conductivity;thermal management (packaging);transmission line matrix methods","3D TLM formulation;C-Al;Global Positioning System satellites;MMC;SiC-Al;aerospace industry;aircraft brake rotors;automotive industry;automotive rotors;braze material;ceramic substrates;communication satellites;copper;electronics cooling;graphite-aluminium;heat diffusion;heat spreader;mass transport;metal matrix composite materials;reaction synthesis;reinforced aluminium;silicon-carbide particulate;space electronic packaging;space electronics systems;space power electronic module;thermal conductivity;thermal expansion;thermal management;transmission line matrix","","","","0","","17","","","20130815","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The response of the devices to reducing gases has been assumed to be due to a reduced metal work function at the metal-oxide interface that shifts the flat band capacitance to lower voltages. We have discovered that high temperature (700 K) exposure to hydrogen results not only in the flat-band voltage occurring at a more negative bias than in oxygen, but also in the transition from accumulation (high capacitance) to inversion (low capacitance) occurring over a relatively narrow voltage range. In oxygen, this transition is broadened, indicating the creation of a high density of interface states. We present a model of the hydrogen/oxygen response based on two independent phenomena: a chemically induced shift in the metal-semiconductor work function difference and the passivation/creation of charged states at the SiO<sub>2</sub>-SiC interface that is much slower than the work function shift.

We present algorithms for extracting connectivity between ports of atomic software components from an AUTOSAR model and for calculating blocking times of all tasks of a taskset scheduled by PCP. We then address optimization issues in mapping AUTOSAR components (SWCs) to distributed multithreaded implementations. We formulate and solve two optimization problems: map SWCs to ECUs with the objective of minimizing the bus load; for a given SWC-to-ECU mapping, map runnable entities on each ECU to OS tasks and assign data consistency mechanism to each shared data item to minimize memory size requirement on each ECU while guaranteeing schedulability of tasksets on all ECUs.","Pending","978-1-4577-0658-5","978-1-4577-0659-2","10.1109/RSP.2011.5929971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929971","ECU;data consistency;schedulability;software component","Assembly;Automotive engineering;Clustering algorithms;Connectors;Memory management;Optimization;Software","automotive electronics;embedded systems;multi-threading;operating systems (computers);optimisation;scheduling;simulation languages;software architecture","AUTOSAR model;atomic software component;automotive embedded system;automotive open system architecture;automotive software development;component-based modeling language;component-to-ECU mapping;distributed hardware platform;distributed multithreaded implementation;optimization problem;real-time operating system","","","","0","","6","","","20110623","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the dual-power-source nature of these vehicles, control strategies based on engineering intuition frequently fail to fully explore the potential of these advanced vehicles. In this paper, we present a procedure for the design of a near-optimal power management strategy. The design procedure starts by defining a cost function, such as minimizing a combination of fuel consumption and selected emission species over a driving cycle. Dynamic programming (DP) is then utilized to find the optimal control actions including the gear-shifting sequence and the power split between the engine and motor while subject to a battery SOC-sustaining constraint. Through analysis of the behavior of DP control actions, near-optimal rules are extracted, which, unlike DP control signals, are implementable. The performance of this power management control strategy is studied by using the hybrid vehicle model HE-VESIM developed at the Automotive Research Center of the University of Michigan. A tradeoff study between fuel economy and emissions was performed. It was found that significant emission reduction could be achieved at the expense of a small increase in fuel consumption.","1063-6536","","","10.1109/TCST.2003.815606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255660","","Automotive engineering;Cost function;Dynamic programming;Energy management;Fuel economy;Intelligent vehicles;Land vehicles;Power engineering and energy;Road vehicles;Vehicle driving","dynamic programming;hybrid electric vehicles;optimal control;power control;regenerative braking","dynamic programming;fuel economy;gear-shifting sequence;hybrid vehicle model HE-VESIM;hybrid vehicle techniques;near-optimal rules;optimal control;parallel hybrid electric truck;power management strategy;powertrain control","","","","177","2","19","","","20040107","","IEEE","IEEE Control Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Eighth IEEE International Symposium on","25-26 March 2004","2004","","","310","311","Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a classical system safety analysis technique which is currently widely used in the automotive, aerospace and other safety critical industries. In the process of an FMEA, analysts compile lists of component failure modes and try to infer the effects of those failure modes on the system. System models, typically simple engineering diagrams, assist analysts in understanding how the local effects of component failures propagate through complex architectures and ultimately cause hazardous effects at system level. Although there is software available that assists engineers in performing clerical tasks, such as forming tables and filling in data, the intelligent part of an FMEA process remains a manual and laborious process. Thus, one of the main criticisms of FMEA is that the time taken to perform the analysis can often exceed the period of the design and development phases and therefore the analysis de facto becomes a mere deliverable to the customer and not a useful tool capable of improving the design. Difficulties naturally become more acute as systems grow in scale and complexity. To address those difficulties, a body of work is looking into the automation and simplification of FMEA (Renovell et al., 1985). To mechanically infer the effects of component failures in a system, several approaches have been proposed which use domain specific qualitative or quantitative fault simulation. These approaches are restricted to particular application domains such as the design of electrical or electronic circuits. Limitations in scope but also difficulties with the efficiency and scalability of algorithms seem to have so far limited the industrial take-up of this automated FMEA technology which is still under development. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the automatic synthesis of FMEAs which builds upon recent work towards automating fault tree analysis (Papadopoulos et al., 2001). In this approach, FMEAs are built from engineering diagrams that have been augmented with information about component failures. The proposed approach is generic, i.e. not restricted to an application domain, and potentially applicable to a range of widely used engineering models. The models that provide the basis for the analysis identif- y the topology of the system, i.e. the system components and the material energy and data transactions among those components. Models can also be hierarchically structured and record in different layers the decomposition of subsystems into more basic components. We should note that this type of structural models include piping and instrumentation diagrams, data flow diagrams and other models commonly used in many areas of engineering design.","1530-2059","0-7695-2094-4","","10.1109/HASE.2004.1281774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281774","","Aerospace engineering;Aerospace industry;Aerospace safety;Automotive engineering;Cause effect analysis;Computer architecture;Data engineering;Failure analysis;Performance analysis;Software performance","data flow analysis;fault trees;safety-critical software;software architecture;software fault tolerance","FMEA;component failure modes;data flow;data transactions;failure effect analysis;failure mode analysis;fault simulation;fault tree analysis;safety critical systems;software design;software development;system models;system safety analysis;system topology","","","","7","3","5","","","20040824","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the wide operating range, the inherent nonlinearities of the induction process and the large modeling uncertainties make the design of the fuel-injection controller very difficult. Also, the unavoidable large time-delay between control action and measurement causes the problem of chattering. In this paper, an observer-based control algorithm based on sliding mode control technique is suggested for fast response and small amplitude chattering of the air-to-fuel ratio. A direct adaptive control using Gaussian networks is applied to the compensation of transient fueling dynamics. The proposed controller is simple enough for on-line computation and is implemented on an automotive engine using a PC-386. The simulation and the experimental results show that this algorithm reduces the chattering magnitude considerably and is robust to modeling errors","","0-7803-1968-0","","10.1109/CDC.1994.411212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=411212","","Adaptive control;Air pollution;Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Control nonlinearities;Engines;Pollution measurement;Robustness;Sliding mode control;Vehicle dynamics","adaptive control;compensation;internal combustion engines;microcomputer applications;observers;variable structure systems","Gaussian networks;SI engines;air-to-fuel ratio;chattering;compensation;direct adaptive control;fuel-injection control;induction process;modeling errors;modeling uncertainties;nonlinearities;observer-based control algorithm;sliding mode control;time-delay;transient fueling dynamics;transient state operation","","","","1","","19","","","20020806","14 Dec 1994-16 Dec 1994","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present work modeling of low pressure square diaphragm piezoresistive MEMS sensor has been done using the available analytical models through their best fitting to match with FEM (Finite Element Method) simulation results. This is done for different aspect (thickness (h) / length (L)) ratios of the diaphragm after discovering that the “h/L” ratio is the prime design parameter. Further, an analytical model for the stress value at diaphragm centre has been proposed whose inevitability is based on the investigation that stress at centre exceeds the stress near the edge of diaphragm with increasing aspect ratios and these values are an important factor for sensor design considering the fact that the level of stress generated in the diaphragm region should be within fracture limit at burst pressure. This work presents analytical models for designing pressure micro sensors applicable to different aspect ratios of diaphragm and thus simplifying the designing of senor without experiencing the limitation of the available models.","","978-1-4673-0456-6","","10.1109/SCES.2012.6199112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6199112","MEMS;micro sensor;piezoresistive;pressure","Analytical models;Finite element methods;Piezoresistance;Resistors;Sensitivity;Simulation;Stress","diaphragms;finite element analysis;microsensors;piezoresistive devices;pressure sensors","FEM simulation;analytical model;automotive industry;avionics industry;biomedical industry;burst pressure fracture limit;diaphragm centre stress value;diaphragm region stress generation level;finite element method simulation;low pressure square diaphragm piezoresistive MEMS sensor;pressure microsensor;prime design parameter","","","","2","","10","","","20120514","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach is based on a new criterion which weights the parameter covariances with the magnitudes of output sensitivities both to reduce the parameter estimation error and also allow the optimization of the output fitness. Optimization using this criterion has a low computational cost and in the case that the regressors are well chosen the performance index approximates that of the I-optimality criterion and results in high output fitness. The new method allows for the efficient use of numerical constrained global optimization algorithms to be applied to magnitude and rate constraints on system inputs and outputs, which are essential considerations in experimental applications. The approach should thus be employable as a component of an iterative bootstrapping procedure for experimental system identification subject to safe operating limits. The approach is applied to the black-box nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output identification of an automotive engine-fueling model as a benchmark. The results are compared with those obtained by other computationally efficient methods of both nonoptimal and optimal type. Statistical validation of the results shows that the design method using the new criterion gives test signals satisfying the required operational constraints which have superior outcomes in output prediction fit.","1545-5955","","","10.1109/TASE.2013.2264810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558486","Black-box modelling constraints;design of experiments (DoEs);nonlinear;prediction error;system identification","","","","","","","0","","","","2013-07-12","","","IEEE","IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Consequently, worst-case response time estimation and schedulability analysis of MSC-based specifications form natural building blocks for designing distributed real-time systems. However, currently there exists a large gap between the timing and quantitative performance analysis techniques that exist in the real-time systems literature, and the modeling/specification techniques that are advocated by the formal methods community. As a result, although a number of schedulability analysis techniques are known for a variety of task graph-based models, it is not clear if they can be used to effectively analyze standard specification formalisms such as MSCs. In this paper we make an attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a schedulability analysis technique for MSC-based system specifications. We show that compared to existing timing analysis techniques for distributed real-time systems, our proposed analysis gives tighter results, which immediately translate to better system design and improved resource dimensioning. We illustrate the details of our analysis using a setup from the automotive electronics domain, which consist of two real-life application programs (that are naturally modeled using MSCs) running on a platform consisting of multiple electronic control units (ECUs) connected via a FlexRay bus.","1545-3421","978-0-7695-3146-5","","10.1109/RTAS.2008.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550794","Message Sequence Charts / Graphs;Schedulability analysis","Application software;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer science;Control systems;Delay;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Timing;Upper bound","formal specification;scheduling;systems analysis","distributed real-time systems;formal methods;message sequence charts;modeling/specification techniques;performance analysis techniques;schedulability analysis;task graph-based models;timing analysis techniques","","","","0","","27","","","20080627","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

All control features and resources are permanently active in an electronic control unit, ensuring the best performance in terms of pollutant emissions and power density, as well as driveability and diagnostics. A way to attain these goals is the adoption of Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine technology. In order to assist the engine management system design, through a better performance of GDI engine and the Common Rail (CR) system, in this work an injection pressure regulation to stabilize the fuel pressure in the CR fuel line is proposed and validated via experiments. The resulting control strategy is composed by a feedback integral action and a static model-based feed-forward action whose gains are scheduled as function of fundamental plant parameters. The tuning of the closed loop performance is then supported by an analysis of the phase margin and the sensitivity function. Preliminary experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the control algorithm in regulating the mean value rail pressure independently from engine working conditions, i.e. engine speed and time of injection, with limited design effort.","0743-1619","978-1-4577-0080-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990940","","Batteries;Engines;Fuels;Manifolds;Mathematical model;Rails;Sensitivity","air pollution control;automotive electronics;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;energy management systems;feedback;feedforward;internal combustion engines;pressure control;rails;research and development;sensitivity analysis;stability","GDI engine;automotive industry;closed loop performance tuning;common rail fuel line;electronic control unit;engine management system design;feedback integral action;fuel pressure stabilization;gasoline direct injection engine;model-based injection pressure controller design;phase margin analysis;pollutant emission reduction;research and development;sensitivity function;static model-based feedforward action;vehicle emission reduction","","","","1","","10","","","20110818","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose the automotive standards organization ASAM (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) has specified a storage standard called Open Data Services (ODS), which allows users to design data models fitted to their specific needs while keeping general classification information for generic use. On the other hand, object oriented concepts have evolved in the software technology domain, and UML has emerged as the most important standard to specify software-based systems.

The model allows an imperfect ground plane to be considered through the complex-image approximation together with propagation losses. Numerical and experimental results are provided as a validation, while an empirical rule to assess the accuracy of the results is proposed.

"RBF network feedforward compensation of load disturbance in idle speed control","Gorinevsky, D.; Feldkamp, L.A.","Dept. of Electr. Eng., British Columbia Univ., Vancouver, BC, Canada","Control Systems, IEEE","Dec 1996","1996","16","6","18","27","Automotive engine idle speed control is a disturbance rejection problem. An engine at idle is typically well away from its most favorable region of operation and exhibits significant nonlinearities. Control of such a system is complicated by delays of both physical (time between induction and power strokes) and computational origin. In the model used, there are two control variables, and these differ in both their range of effectiveness and their temporal characteristics: spark advance is fast-acting but limited in its effect, while throttle has a large range but a slower effect which results both from the dynamics of filling the intake manifold and from the induction-power delay. The spark variable also has a maximum effective value, i.e., a value beyond which it has an effect opposite to that expected. This article describes a nonlinear adaptive feedforward controller for compensation of external load disturbances in the idle speed control of an automotive engine. The controller is based on a radial basis function (RBF) network approximation of certain input-output mappings describing the system. An underlying assumption used in the controller design is that the external engine load is known to the controller. In particular, that might be achieved by putting an appropriate torque sensor in the powertrain or using other available information","1066-033X","","","10.1109/37.546267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=546267","","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Delay effects;Engines;Physics computing;Power system modeling;Radial basis function networks;Sparks;Vehicle dynamics;Velocity control","adaptive control;angular velocity control;automobiles;compensation;delays;feedforward neural nets;internal combustion engines;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;stability","I/O mappings;RBF network feedforward compensation;automotive engine idle speed control;compensation;delays;disturbance rejection;external engine load;external load disturbances;induction-power delay;input-output mappings;intake manifold filling;load disturbance;maximum effective value;nonlinear adaptive feedforward controller;nonlinearities;radial basis function;spark advance;torque sensor","","","","11","","21","","","20020806","","IEEE","","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many cases reviewers use checklists to guide their analysis during review sessions. However, valuable, checklist-based code-reviews have the principal shortcoming of their high costs due to lack of supporting tools enabling at least partial automation of typical multiple appearing rules. This paper describes an approach towards semi-automation of some steps of individual review processes based on checklists. The method proposed is interactive, i.e. reviewers will be enabled to actualize, extend, and check the consistency and redundancy of their checklists. The basic idea underlying the approach is the usage of a rule-based system, adapting concepts of the compiler theory and knowledge engineering, for acquisition and representation of knowledge about the program. Redundant and conflicting knowledge about the program under study is recognized and solved by means of an embedded truth maintenance system. As a result of fault diagnosis, rules for fault classification are used. Software reliability models are applied to validate the results of each review session.

In order to accelerate the subsequent analysis of the tremendous amount of data, it is advisable to pre-filter the recorded log data on device, during the test-drive. To enable the test engineer of creating data analyses we built a component-based library on top of the languages System{C}/C++. Problematic with this approach is that still substantial programming knowledge is required for implementing filter algorithms, which is usually not the domain of a vehicle test engineer. In a next step we developed a graphical modelling language on top of our library and a graphical editor. The editor is able of verifying a model as well as of generating source code which eliminates the need of manually implementing a filter algorithm. In our contribution we show the design of the graphical language and the editor using the Eclipse platform and the Graphical Modelling Framework (GMF). We describe the automatic extraction of meta-information, such as available components, their interfaces and categorization annotations by parsing the library's C++ implementation with the help of Xtext.

The safety-criticality of the system requires the application of Preliminary Hazard Analysis early in the development process. This is a necessary first step for the development of an automotive embedded system that is acceptably safe. Goal of this activity is the identification and classification of hazards and the definition of top level safety requirements that are the basis for designing a safety-critical embedded system that is able to control or mitigate the identified hazards. A computeraided framework to support Preliminary Hazard Analysis for automotive embedded systems is presented in this work. The contribution consists of (1) an enhancement for Preliminary Hazard Analysis to the domain-specific language EAST-ADL, as well as (2) the identification of properties that indicate the correct application of Preliminary Hazard Analysis using the language. These properties and an analysis model reflecting the results of the Preliminary Hazard Analysis are used for the automated detection of an erroneously applied Preliminary Hazard Analysis (property checker) and the automated suggestion and application of corrective measures (model corrector).

Most of existing SOA design methodologies advocate identifying services from the top-down decomposition of business processes. However, the identification quality in these methodologies heavily depends on the expertise and experience of individual designers. The ability to quantitatively evaluate service identification is absolutely needed. In this paper, we propose an approach that supports such evaluation by applying the measurement technology to the service-based business process decomposition. A model to capture related architectural elements with their relationships is presented. A set of design metrics are proposed for measuring various features of identified services in the service portfolio, including service granularity, coupling, cohesion, and business entity convergence. To apply the approach, a prototypical measurement tool for service identification is developed.

In light of the fact that a failure of an automotive programmable electronic system may lead to injuries and even loss of life it is extremely important to perform the hazard analysis during the process of design and development of these systems to minimize the risk of the occurrence of such disastrous events. In this paper, a comprehensive hazard analysis method based on functional model is proposed. This method overcomes the narrower scope of individual techniques while obtaining the benefits of all of them.

In addition, scheduling policies and parameters, both for the ECUs and the buses, need to be specified. Code generation/optimization from the Simulink/Stateflow models, task partitioning and mapping decisions, as well as the parameters chosen for the schedulers - all of these impact the execution times and timing behaviour of the control tasks and control messages.

In recent years, ambitious efforts at increasing the abstraction level of formal design languages have been presented in order to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, certain parts of all systems still have to be described in detail. Unfortunately, even small analog parts can slow down a global system simulation significantly. It is therefore necessary to generate abstract models with reduced but adequate result accuracy for these ldquobottleneckrdquo components. This paper presents a novel approach to the automated generation and evaluation of abstract behavioural models for automotive applications. Our methodology aims at achieving a convincing speedup in global system verification by accelerating the transient simulation of the crucial analog and mixed-signal components. The speedup results not only from an increased level of abstraction but also from a fast generation of circuit equations without the need for numerical integration. The approach is able to handle nonlinear circuits by employing piecewise linear models. The use of a SystemC interface will allow effortless integration into manifold simulation environments.","","978-1-4244-2264-7","","10.1109/FDL.2008.4641424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641424","","Acceleration;Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Circuit simulation;Design methodology;Hardware design languages;Microelectronics;Nonlinear circuits;Nonlinear equations;Safety","automobiles;formal languages;piecewise linear techniques;user interfaces","HDL-based design;SystemC interface;analog-mixed-signal components;automotive domain;bottleneck components;circuit equations;global system simulation;global system verification;high-level modelling;nonlinear circuits;piecewise linear models;transient simulation","","","","2","","15","","","20081010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address these limitations by extending the EAST-ADL notation with energy constraints and integrating this extension with formal modeling and analysis techniques. We provide a mapping scheme as the basis for automatic model transformation between the extended EAST-ADL and priced timed automata for model checking.

In this paper, we assume that the load disturbance is known to the controller and demonstrate high-performance nonlinear adaptive feedforward compensation of this disturbance. The on-line parametric optimization technique applied in this paper to the design of the nonlinear adaptive feedforward controller uses an RBF network for approximating nonlinear vector fields defining the controller.

We propose a synthesis-based design methodology that relieves the designers from the burden of specifying detailed mechanisms for addressing platform faults, while involving them in the definition of the overall fault-tolerance strategy. Thus, they can focus on addressing plant faults within their control algorithms, selecting the best components for the execution platform, and defining an accurate fault model. Our approach is centered on a new model of computation, fault tolerant data flows (FTDF), that enables the integration of formal validation techniques.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269049","","Application software;Automotive applications;Control systems;Costs;Design methodology;Embedded software;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Real time systems;Software algorithms","control system synthesis;data flow computing;embedded systems;fault tolerant computing;feedback","automotive applications;control algorithms;cost sensitive real time feedback control design;embedded software;execution platform;fault model;fault tolerance strategy;fault tolerant data flows;formal validation techniques;plant fault addressing;safety-critical applications;synthesis based design methodology","","","","20","","25","","","20040308","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This architecture offers a network independent interface and adapted real-time system and transport services while taking into account the constraints of automotive applications in terms of size and cost. It lies upon the specification of three standards defining respectively an operating system, a communication model and network management facilities. This approach is a major step for the on-board vehicle networking since it eases the application portability and the equipment interoperability, and it avoids the costly development of proprietary solutions. The success of this initiative will clearly depend on the level of confidence in the products implementing the OSEK/VDX standards and potentially designed by different third parties in a totally open market. Therefore, to impede the emergence of a large variety of non-compliant implementations, there is a need to specify conformance tests and develop the corresponding tools, able to assess products' conformity to the OSEK/VDX specification. Another key to a successful application of the OSEK/VDX layered model is the vertical integration of hardware, software and system aspects. The quality of the validation process during integration is of prior importance since it guarantees the safety of mass applications involving human beings. The role falling to conformance tools in such operations is to assist equipment or system designers and offer solutions to master the progressive integration of OSEK/VDX components into the target system","","","","10.1049/ic:19981078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=744167","","","conformance testing","MODISTARC;OSEK/VDX conformance testing;application portability;automotive community;communication model;conformance tests;interoperability;modular architecture;network management facilities;network-based distributed applications;operating system;real-time system","","","","0","","","","","20020806","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

We assess air cooling of power electronic components using laminar airflow micro-channel heat exchangers. Comparisons are made with ethylene glycol systems commonly used in tandem with engine cooling. Our analysis shows that despite a lower coefficient of performance and higher parasitic losses, air cooling compares quite favorably, offering lower mass, fewer components, and a lower projected cost. Air cooling also has many significant, less obvious advantages such as simpler design and greater reliability. Micro-channel heat exchangers appear to offer the most promise and can be further enhanced by simple design changes, such as reducing passage lengths. Direct air cooling appears to be a viable option for the current generation of silicon-based power switches and will be more attractive for anticipated future electronic components made of materials that operate at higher temperatures. Continuing work includes experimentation and data validation. Recommendations for future research include fabricating and testing air-cooled inverters. A micro-channel performance estimator program we developed was found to over-project heat flux in comparison to a more detailed computational fluid dynamics model. However, the program provides an initial estimate that can be used as a quick, convenient means of estimating micro-channel heat transfer with a variety of configurations and fluids.","1087-9870","978-1-4244-1700-1","978-1-4244-1701-8","10.1109/ITHERM.2008.4544251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4544251","air cooling;heat exchanger;heat transfer;laminar flow;micro-channel;power electronics","Anti-freeze;Automotive engineering;Costs;DC generators;Electronics cooling;Engines;Performance analysis;Performance loss;Power electronics;Power generation","automotive electronics;cooling;heat exchangers;laminar flow;microchannel flow","air cooling;air-cooled inverter;automotive power electronics;computational fluid dynamics model;engine cooling;laminar airflow microchannel heat exchanger;microchannel heat transfer;microchannel performance estimator program;power electronic component;stringent cooling requirement","","","","1","","9","","","20080617","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We explored how the look-up table (LUT) controllers and one special type of Mamdani fuzzy controllers were mathematically related and how to represent the former by the latter. A LUT controller is one of the most widely used tools in industry, especially in automotive engineering. The reasons for its popularity are the strong nonlineraity and multimodal behaviors that can be, in many cases, formalized only by experimentally measured data. Our approach was inspired by the similarity between the fuzzy controllers and LUTs and we used the theory of fuzzy controllers to bring new light to the LUT-based engineering technique that is usually considered as a low tech or “black art” type of control tool. We developed a local stability criterion for feedback control systems with LUT controllers. Based on this, we developed a practical design procedure for constructing a LUT control system that is guaranteed to be at least locally stable under the assumptions that (1) the nonlinear system's mathematical model is unknown, and (2) the system is linearizable at the equilibrium (most practical systems meet this assumption).","","","","10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6608520","","Control systems;Equations;Fuzzy sets;Interpolation;Mathematical model;Stability analysis;Table lookup","control nonlinearities;feedback;fuzzy control;nonlinear control systems;stability criteria;table lookup","LUT controller;LUT-based engineering technique;Mamdani fuzzy controllers;automotive engineering;black art control tool;feedback control systems;look-up table controllers;multimodal behaviors;nonlinear system mathematical model;nonlineraity behaviors;real-world applications;stability criterion","","","","0","","12","","","20130926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To meet aggressive power density requirements, it was necessary to operate the three-stage interleaved converter magnetics near the edge of saturation of the boost inductors. Under large load transients the converter control needed to operate the converter as a current source to prevent hard saturation of the magnetics. The predictive limiter was used to achieve maximum slew rate while limiting the current. The implementation used background model calculation and lookup tables to minimize real-time computation and associated delay.

They are increasingly important in mission-critical infrastructures in different domains including automotive, healthcare, energy and transportation sectors. As such, the adequate testing and validation of such infrastructures are of prime importance. Mechatronic systems testing has been supported by different isolated industrial and research approaches including automated test infrastructures, model-based testing, and test execution engines. While these approaches have individual benefits, they are usually applied in isolation, suffering from different weaknesses. This paper reports on an integrated model-driven approach for mechatronic systems testing, where existing approaches are combined and enhanced. The result is unprecedented levels of automation and testability.

This study proposes a full characterization of a RF link between a transmitter (badge) and a receiver (integrated in the structure of the car). As the design of a car is relevant with a multi-scale analysis, the needs can vary from a car to another one: we propose a strategy based on the development of generic wireless modules to cut the development costs. Therefore, the medium of propagation influence is intensively characterized to develop matched strategies for secured data propagation. First, an empirical analysis describes on the radio channel characterization for the car access systems. Then, the received field is measured in 2D around the vehicle for different various parameters (vehicle frame, antennas relative heights, badge and receiver's position and relative distance).

The method uses the direct intelligent control paradigm. The procedure is based on partitioning of the state space into small rectangles called cell groups, and quantization of the states and the available controls into finite levels or bins. Membership functions are then assigned for the state and controls. The transition from one conditional subspace to another is accomplished via a center-point mapping of the cell groups, under the applied action of each if-then rule. The systematic aspects of the procedure refer to the way transitional elements are clustered on the basis of an explicitly defined performance measure. Optimum transitions are selected using a search procedure. The fuzzy rules are generated automatically for transitioning from any initial cell group to the target cell group. A simplified engine model for idling speed control is used as the testbed for development and demonstration purposes.<<ETX>>","1066-033X","","","10.1109/37.214946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=214946","","Automotive engineering;Control design;Control systems;Engines;Fuzzy logic;Intelligent control;Quantization;State-space methods;Testing;Velocity control","automobiles;control system synthesis;fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;intelligent control;internal combustion engines;state-space methods;velocity control","automotive engine;cell groups;idling speed control;if-then rule;intelligent control;membership functions;quantization;search procedure;state space;systematic fuzzy logic control","","","","32","","21","","","20020806","","IEEE","","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The work is motivated by applications in automated vehicles inspection and screening in security applications. The proposed path planning strategy is developed based on a perception-modeling-planning-action approach. Raw data rapidly captured by a calibrated network of Kinect sensors are processed to provide the required 3D surface shape of objects, normal measurements, orientation estimation, and obstacle detection. A robust motion planning method is designed that relies on this information, resulting in a safe trajectory that is planned to follow and explore the curved surfaces while avoiding collision with protruding components of the vehicle.

A kind of dual control algorithm is proposed in the paper. That means in the large-signal control mode as start-up period of throttle valve from zero, the entire system is regarded as linear and the response is determined by the PID controller; while in the small-signal control mode during running time, the nonlinear friction and spring force compensator and air disturbance has the dominant influence on the control system behavior. Then it substitutes the original control models on Matlab/Simulink platform combined with the models from Xilinx Blockset library, and simulates the system simultaneously by software and co-hardware to verify the design.

Integrated circuit technology is best suited to manufacture sensor arrays with excellent precision of the relative positioning of the individual sensor elements. Moreover sensor signals can be directly processed on chip eliminating problems caused by additional external connections. Very little real estate on the chip is needed for the sensor devices, thus making the integration of them very cost-effective. Both magnetic and optical sensor arrays are discussed. Key parameters for a magnetic sensor include the resistance, the magnetic sensitivity, the offset remaining after the current spinning technique and the integrated excitation coil. Specific examples in state of the art 0.35 μm CMOS technology are presented. We also present modelling of integrated sensor devices based on characterisation and process monitoring data. Furthermore, life-time effects and design for production test solutions are reviewed. Modelling of integrated sensors in the same way as other devices is of critical importance in the practical design of industrial products in a CMOS process. As an example a 10 bit resolution absolute angle sensor is presented. It offers a full self-calibrating system including digital signal processing for the calculation of the measured angle.

A solution is to use III-V materials alloys having semiconductor, piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties. These materials, particularly nitrides such as GaN or AlN, enable advanced design of devices suitable for harsh environment. A micromechanical structure based on AlGaN/GaN/AlN cantilevers coupled with a High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) is stress-sensitive and can act as a mechanical sensing device suited to harsh environments. The study of stress distribution after the structure release is necessary to assess its possible influence on the HEMT output. In this article, we propose a method to evaluate these stresses that is based on topology measurements. By coupling numerical modelling and laser interferometry measurements, both intrinsic and residual stresses, respectively the stress before and after release, are calculated. These results are then corroborated by stress measurements using MicroRaman spectroscopy. A residual stress distribution ranging from 140 MPa to 260 MPa is obtained in the HEMT area. However, the influence of this stress can be neglected against the influence of spontaneous polarization in GaN alloys.","","978-1-4577-0623-3","978-1-4577-0622-6","10.1109/IWASI.2011.6004678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004678","","Aluminum gallium nitride;Gallium nitride;HEMTs;Residual stresses;Sensors;Stress measurement","III-V semiconductors;aluminium compounds;cantilevers;gallium compounds;high electron mobility transistors;internal stresses;light interferometry;microsensors;stress measurement;wide band gap semiconductors","AlGaN-GaN-AlN;HEMT;III-V material alloy;MicroRaman spectroscopy;built-in stress distribution;electromechanical system;harsh environments;heterostructure based cantilever;high electron mobility transistor;intrinsic stresses;laser interferometry measurement;mechanical sensing;micromechanical structure;numerical modelling;piezoelectric properties;pyroelectric properties;residual stresses;semiconductor properties;stress measurement","","","","0","","11","","","20110829","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a rich variety of both hardware configurations of automotive environment sensor systems and strategies for sensor data fusion and processing. For sensor systems assembled of multiple devices, the trade-off between increased spatial coverage, robustness against interfering factors and accuracy of measured data is a crucial aspect of system design. We investigate up-to-date automotive sensor systems with respect to detection performance and detection quality.

The study provides the direction of the determination of PSD planetary gear ratio. The simulation model is developed by using MATLAB.

When no safe alternative to normal service exists, a system must be dependable to be safe, that is, it must have reliable ways to deliver a certain quality of service. Our collaborations with industrial partners have focused on HIRTS modeling techniques. Initially, we explored the potential benefits that the most successful software architecture and modeling approaches could bring to the safety-critical domain. We subsequently designed the architecture information modeling language. AIM lets us exploit the available technologies from the same platform and thus provide stronger support for the safety case. A safety case, a key element in HIRTS certification, typically consists of a high-level argument and supporting evidence.

"Diagnosis of Sheet Metal Stamping Processes Based on 3-D Thermal Energy Distribution","Yiu-Ming Harry Ng; Maolin Yu; Ying Huang; Ruxu Du","Dept. of Autom. & Comput.-Aided Eng., Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong, Shatin","Automation Science and Engineering, IEEE Transactions on","Jan. 2007","2007","4","1","22","30","In this paper, a new approach is proposed using the 3-D thermal energy distribution of the workpiece. The new approach is based on the fact that during the stamping process, the workpiece absorbs energy to deform. This mechanical energy is converted into thermal energy. Therefore, it is possible to diagnose the stamping by analyzing the 3-D thermal energy distribution. In practice, the thermal energy distribution can be acquired using an infrared camera. However, it is often necessary to reconstruct the 3-D thermal energy distribution, which can be accomplished by using the Octree algorithm. On the other hand, one can compute the thermal energy distribution through finite-element modeling (FEM) as the baseline for diagnosis. Then, by comparison, the diagnosis can be carried out. A couple of examples are presented in detail together with the experiment validation. Note to Practitioners-These days computer-aided design (CAD) and finite-element modeling (FEM) are widely used for sheet metal stamping, especially in the automotive and aerospace industries. However, fault diagnosis and die tryout still rely heavily on the experiences of the engineers/machinists on the shop floor. An existing diagnosis method compares the strain distribution calculated using FEM and the experimental strain distribution, which is calculated from the measured deformation of the initial grid pattern. However, this method is time consuming as it requires the initial grid pattern preparation by either chemical etching or laser marking. This paper presents a new method for diagnosing sheet metal stamping processes. The new method compares the thermal distribution calculated using FEM and the experimental thermal distribution result, which can be acquired using an infrared (IR) camera. Therefore, it is more convenient to use it on the shop floor. The thermal FEM can be found based on strain FEM. However, the infrared image is 2-D and, hence, 3-D thermal distribution reconstruction is often necess- ary. This paper includes several practical examples. Some practical concerns, such as the conduction heat lost to the environment and the infrared camera viewing angles, are also discussed","1545-5955","","","10.1109/TASE.2006.873227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4049770","Fault diagnosis;infrared (IR) imaging;sheet metal stamping;similarity analysis","Automotive engineering;Cameras;Chemical lasers;Design automation;Distributed computing;Finite element methods;Image reconstruction;Infrared heating;Mechanical energy;Strain measurement","finite element analysis;metal stamping;octrees;sheet metal processing","3D thermal energy distribution;finite-element modeling;mechanical energy;octree algorithm;sheet metal stamping processes","","","","1","","30","","","20070102","","IEEE","IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Signal perturbations such as small amounts of noise, shift, and spikes, can sometimes severely hamper the performance of the system, apart from complete failure of components and links. Finding minimal counterexamples (perturbations on the system leading to violation of fault-tolerance requirements) can be of great assistance to control system designers in understanding and adjusting the fault-tolerance behavior of the system. Fault injection is an effective method for dependability analysis of such systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of dominating sets of perturbations, and define a minimal set of counterexamples called the basis. We propose effective methods using a simulation-based fault injection technique on Simulink models for finding the basis set at an early stage of design, given the fault specification and fault-tolerance requirements.

Thus, electronic control units for drivetrain systems, such as automatic transmissions, have become much more complex. This increases the need for more complex control systems that traditionally have to be calibrated in a time-consuming process before production. We propose a new method of designing controllers for the shift procedure in automatic transmissions that have the same capabilities as the traditional control systems, but require less calibration. To this end, we introduce adaptive λ-tracking controllers based on the high-gain feedback principle to replace the current control scheme. In order to ensure high-gain stability, we provide a comprehensive system analysis based on a nonlinear system model and investigate the relative degree and the minimum-phase property in detail.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6669205","","Calibration;Control systems;Gears;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Pistons;Valves;Vehicles","adaptive control;automotive components;control system synthesis;drives;feedback;mechanical variables control;nonlinear systems;power transmission (mechanical)","adaptive λ-tracking controllers;automatic transmissions;automotive drivetrain systems;complex control systems;comprehensive system analysis;control systems;current control scheme;designing controllers;electronic control units;energy-optimal set points;engine operation;fuel consumption reduction;high-gain feedback principle;high-gain feedback stability;minimum-phase property;nonlinear drivetrain system;nonlinear system model;passenger cars;shift procedure;time-consuming process","","","","0","","","","","20131202","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"On-board diagnostics for control of vehicle emissions","Greening, P.","","Vehicle Diagnostics in Europe, IEE Colloquium on","23 Feb 1994","1994","","","5/1","5/6","Within the EC, new motor vehicles are subject to type approval and conformity of production requirements that seek to ensure that they meet tailpipe emission standards for carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and, in the case of diesels, particulates when they first enter into service. On-board diagnostics (OBD) is an area of automotive technology that is developing rapidly, not just for emissions. From the point of view of the authority, OBD offers the possibility of maintaining emissions performance over a vehicle's lifetime. Simplistically, an OBD regulation or directive need only state that if certain emission thresholds are exceeded, the OBD system should recognise it and indicate to the driver that a fault exists, leaving system design and functioning to the manufacturer. However, the need for harmonising standards across world markets is clear in order to avoid a proliferation of standards for OBD systems and so the UK is taking the lead in Europe by making a proposal for OBD systems based on the EPA requirements for 1994 model year passenger cars and light commercial vehicles","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=289040","","","","","","","","1","","","","","20020806","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

Currently, the automotive industry considers the replacement of mechanical or hydraulic implementations of safety-critical automotive systems (e.g., braking, steering) by electronic counterparts (so-called ""by-wire systems"") for safety, comfort, and cost reasons. In order to remain operational in the presence of faults, these kinds of systems are built as fault-tolerant distributed real-time systems consisting of interconnected control units. To assure the correct operation of the fault tolerance mechanisms, software implemented fault injection provides low cost and easy to control techniques to test the system under faulty conditions. In this paper we propose a distributed software implemented fault injection framework based on the mobile agent approach. Software agents are designed to utilize the real-time system's global time and messages to trigger the fault injection experiments. We introduce a lightweight agent implementation language to model the fault injection and the concerned system resources, agent migration and logging of the fault injection experiments.","","0-7695-2056-1","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265708","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Costs;Electronics industry;Fault tolerant systems;Microprocessors;Mobile agents;Real time systems;Software safety","mobile agents;safety-critical software;software fault tolerance","automotive industry;by-wire systems;distributed software implemented fault injection;drive-by-wire application;electronic devices;fault injection software;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant distributed real-time systems;lightweight agent implementation language;mobile agents;real-time system;safety;safety-critical automotive systems;safety-critical distributed systems;software agents","","","","2","","","","","20040226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Embedded systems have to rely on high quality hardware as well as high quality software. Software development for embedded systems is often a complex undertaking and fundamentally different from that of non-embedded systems. Complexity arises from the need to co-design and create software at low-level of abstraction that also interacts closely with hardware with strong emphasis on dependability and mission-critical real-time constraints. Compared to traditional software development, the increasing complexity also exacerbates challenges in embedded software development processes, such as troubles in achieving sufficient product quality and timely delivery. In order to tackle these challenges in embedded software development, industry needs to apply software engineering technologies that are appropriate for specific situations. The 2nd International Workshop on Software Engineering for Embedded Systems (SEES 2012) Workshop, in conjunction with International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2012) in Zurich, Switzerland, aims to provide researchers and practitioners an international forum to discuss the issues, challenges in adopting software engineering methods for embedded systems development. Further, the overall goal of the workshop is to identify the research opportunities and develop a research agenda to tackle the challenges. The workshop program committee selected nine papers from eighteen submissions for the workshop proceedings. They cover several interesting software-related aspects of embedded systems development, such as software-system architecture, development process, component- and model-based development, and automotive development. The diversity of topics and the decent number of submissions indicate what a vibrant community there is in the intersection of software engineering and embedded systems.- It encourages us to further discover and contribute to this growing community.","","978-1-4673-1852-5","","10.1109/SEES.2012.6225483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225483","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20120628","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is based on the main EME-relevant parameters of digital circuits, i.e. dynamic power and clock rates. This information should be even available before the IC design phase starts. With this approach, the models can be created without any additional information about module size, functional patterns or embedded decoupling capacitors. Thus it can be used to perform design studies wrt. clock rate selection, clock modulation and impact of dynamic power consumption. The modelling and simulation software can even handle very complex ICs like high-end 32-bit microcontrollers. The program is named EMISoC which stands for “EMI simulation of systems-on-chip”. It has been validated for existing 65 nm CMOS designs and is currently used for emission estimations of future 40 nm microcontrollers for automotive applications.

Designing a vibration absorber consists of selecting its mechanical properties. In the automotive industry, the final design phase usually comprises extensive tests with different absorbers in the vehicle and subjective and objective evaluation of the results. This requires hardware modifications between different tests. In this paper, an approach is suggested that can assist in the development of vibration absorbers. It is based on tuning an active vibration control system such that it reproduces the behavior of a specified vibration absorber. This behavior can then be changed electronically without modifying the hardware. Two different control approaches are compared. In the first approach, the apparent physical properties of a vibration absorber are directly modified through well-known acceleration, velocity or displacement feedback structures. In the second approach, a desired dynamic mass transfer function for the vibration absorber is prescribed and an H<sub>2</sub>-norm optimal model matching problem is solved. Both approaches are straightforward from a theoretical point of view, however, some problems occurred during the practical implementation.

One area that merits attention is the safety issue of when a child is left alone in a parked vehicle during the summer months when the ambient air temperatures are warmer. Injuries and deaths of infants, young children, and elderly adults have occurred due to elevated body temperatures for prolonged time periods. One proposed solution is the design of a car safety seat that offers temporary thermal protection to the occupant. This seat features thermoelectric cooling and forced air convection to maintain the body temperature within acceptable ranges for a limited time. In this paper, a system thermal model and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the thermoelectric-based safety system. The experimental system demonstrates the capability of maintaining localized cabin air temperatures below critical survivability thresholds in a closed parked vehicle for up to 95 minutes. This represents an 85% increase over standard child seating units, in cabin temperatures up to 69°C, for an emulated 7 kg infant.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2191427","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172255","Analysis;automotive safety;child safety seat;modeling;occupant protection;test;thermoelectric devices","Cooling;Heat transfer;Heating;Humans;Mathematical model;Safety;Vehicles","road safety;thermoelectric cooling","ambient air temperatures;car safety seat;critical survivability thresholds;forced air convection;integrated child safety seat cooling system;localized cabin air temperatures;mass 7 kg;parked vehicle;system thermal model;temperature 69 degC;thermal protection;thermoelectric cooling;vehicle safety","","","","0","","20","","2012-03-20","20120612","","IEEE","IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Precise velocity control is often required in applications such as computer disk drives. However, one of the challenges encountered is, often times, it is hard to exactly determine the loading condition of the motor. The inaccurate model from this uncertain loading condition may result in erratic velocity control. This paper presents an experimental approach to characterize a DC servo motor loaded with an unknown torque: a steady-state approach is proposed to estimate the parameters of the entire loaded system. Based on the transfer function, a PID controller is designed to validate the resulted model. In the demonstration, a DC servo motor included in a Feedback® 33-100 mechanical unit was utilized.

Future products must satisfy ever more stringent requirements in terms of cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability. The optimization of design and packaging technology for temperatures above 150deg C represents a great challenge for development engineers. The topic complex covers reliability and the prediction of service life. Thermo-mechanical stability is examined on the basis of the layout of the components. The test prototypes fabricated for thin films rarely model the relationships of the original specimen correctly and allow conclusions to be drawn that apply to the latter. During real operation, the points of interest in such a component are also usually completely inaccessible to any measurement method or perturb the operation of the component, so that simulation calculations are the only way of correctly predicting material stresses. Abrupt material transitions in thin films tend to fracture, while plastic or creeping embedded layers tend to fatigue in response to temperature stresses and thermal mismatch of the coefficients of expansion. This means that weak points in particular must already be excluded as early as the development phase. The mechanical stress is analyzed and possible fracture points identified. The real thermo-mechanical stresses are calculated for this purpose by means of finite element simulation. Suitable parameters were selected for the fatigue modeling and the damage was evaluated by means of service-life models. The simulation takes into account non-linear material behavior such as temperature-dependent plastic behavior and viscoplasticity. A model containing the speed of crack formation in a cyclically stressed PbSnAg solder as a function of the parameter causing the damage, such as the energy dissipated per cycle, will ultimately be specified.","","978-3-8007-2972-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5758031","","Plastics","","","","","","0","","","","","20110601","","VDE","","VDE Conference Publications"

IEEE","6-8 Sept. 2006","2006","","","1","6","The escalating number of vehicles on the road has raised awareness to their environmental impacts and sustainability; this has provided a stimulus for future mobility considerations. The conventional car may not meet future requirements regarding noise, emissions and energy consumption. There is a distinct lack of short-term alternative solutions that meet consumer requirements and have a potential for mass production. Furthermore, the internal combustion engine has been developed over 100 years and there may be some risk that the automotive companies choose to invest into the ""wrong"" alternative. However, industry has to accept some responsibility for providing future solutions for the products they introduced and created the demand for in first place. Starting with a vision several years ago, Japanese car companies have now taken the lead with certain types of hybrid electric vehicles. These vehicles exhibit significantly reduced energy consumption, noise emission, exhaust emissions, and yet also have improved comfort and performance. They now thrive in the USA with seemingly unexpected popularity due to rocketing oil prices and increasing awareness of the risk of oil dependency. Many car companies now follow this lead. However, there are a vast variety of possible hybrid drivetrain configurations. Modelling and simulation can help in the development and assessment of future drivetrain solutions. This paper focuses on this task using a commercially available modelling and simulation package. A drivetrain design is developed going through some initial considerations based on vehicle performance criteria that take into account consumer expectations and operational/regulatory/environmental factors. Based on simulation studies the drive train components are identified, mostly from the available range. Finally, a computer simulation is used to assess the performance of the vehicle. The result of these investigations is a series hybrid electric vehicle that is recharged- - from the mains. The fuel consumption is four times better than that of a comparable car, but vehicle mass and cost have not increased significantly. The driving range of this vehicle is not limited by battery capacity. Such a vehicle can meet consumer expectations as well as environmental requirements with added driver comfort. Still being low-cost, it provides the potential for mass-production thus reducing overall impacts on the environment","","1-4244-0158-5","1-4244-0159-3","10.1109/VPPC.2006.364315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211343","cost;energy consumption;hybrid electric vehicle;lithium-ion battery;vehicle performance","Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Hybrid electric vehicles;Internal combustion engines;Mass production;Petroleum;Road vehicles;Vehicle driving;Working environment noise","energy consumption;environmental factors;hybrid electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;power transmission (mechanical)","Japanese car companies;battery capacity;consumer requirements;energy consumption reduction;hybrid electric vehicle drivetrain configurations;internal combustion engine;mass production;operational-regulatory-environmental factors;system modeling;vehicle performance criteria","","","","3","1","16","","","20070529","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We therefore build on the seven layer model of collaboration and follow the design approach for collaboration processes. This paper describes the methodology by means of a real-world case at a company from the automotive industry. The one-day workshop at the company resulted in 565 ideas which were worked out in six project proposals, each solving a specific customer problem. Our research demonstrates that collaboration engineering can be applied to the outcome driven approach, and extends the outcome driven approach by collaboration aspects.","1530-1605","978-1-4244-9618-1","","10.1109/HICSS.2011.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718481","","Collaboration;Companies;Conferences;Information systems;Lead;Proposals;Technological innovation","automobile industry;customer relationship management;design;innovation management;organisational aspects","automotive industry;collaboration engineering;customer problem;innovation design processes;innovations companies;outcome-driven approach;outcome-driven perspective;repeatable collaboration process","","","","0","","25","","","20110222","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this summary paper, we present a methodology for fault modeling and fault diagnosis of analog circuits based on machine learning. A defect filter is used to recognize the type of fault (parametric or catastrophic), inverse regression functions are used to locate and predict the values of parametric faults, and multi-class classifiers are used to list catastrophic faults according to their likelihood of occurrence.

The measurement at high temperature (up to 600°C) has necessitated the development of a new and innovative electrostatic transducer. In this work a structured thermally oxidized silicon backplate covered with a bulk conducting 3μm titanium foil as membrane is used instead of e.g. a metallized polymer film. This configuration enables the application of transit-time flowmeters to the measurement of hot pulsating gas flows (up to 3kHz). Knowledge of the influence of the temperature and velocity profiles on the wave propagation in this high temperature range is essential for design improvements and operating and accuracy limits of the gas flowmeter. This paper presents a numerical 3-D procedure based on Ray-tracing to simulate the sound refraction and drift due to different temperature and velocity profiles for several transducer arrangements. The limits and dynamics of the used profiles are taken from measured data acquired on an exhaust train of an automotive combustion engine, as an exemplary application under extreme operating conditions. The wave propagation is modelled for a heatable double-path flowmeter with transducers of finite surface. Due to the high dynamics of the temperature variations and the thermal inertia of the flowmeter, negative temperature gradients must be taken into account. Since they result in focusing the wave front and a reversed refraction direction. The physical limits of transit-time flow metering in such hot gases can be determined. The up and down stream travel times and the best-case-normalized transmitter-receiver pressure ratios are presented for different working conditions and measuring set-ups. These results have been used to optimize the design of the measurement cell and to find the temperature-induced correction of the usually used equation to calculate the gas flow velocity. Additionally, clear 3-D visualizations of the wave fronts and their temporal propagation through the gas are generated.","","0-7803-7922-5","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2003.1293154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1293154","","Acoustic propagation;Electrostatic measurements;Fluid flow;Numerical simulation;Piezoelectric transducers;Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement;Ultrasonic transducers;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Vehicle dynamics","flowmeters;high-temperature effects;ray tracing;transit time devices;ultrasonic transducers","Ray-tracing;automotive combustion engine;electrostatic transducers;finite surface;gas flow velocity;gas flowmeters;heatable double-path flowmeter;high temperature gas flows;hot pulsating gas flows;metallized polymer film;piezoelectric transducers;reversed refraction direction;sound refraction;temperature profile;temporal propagation;thermal inertia;thermally oxidized silicon backplate;titanium foil;ultrasonic transit-time flowmeter;velocity profile;wave front focusing;wave propagation","","","","3","1","","","","20040504","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inter-vehicle communication, an important component of intelligent transportation system, performs crucial functions in collision avoidance, road-hazard notification, and coordinated driving system. An inter-vehicle communication network is an instantiation of a mobile ad hoc network, which is characterized by multi-hop wireless communications among mobile nodes without any centralized control infrastructure. However, automotive ad hoc networks behaves in fundamentally different ways than the models that predominate mobile ad hoc network research. Driver behavior, constraints on mobility and high speeds create unique characteristics in such networks. They are characterized by rapid but somewhat predictable topology changes, with frequent fragmentation, a small effective network diameter, and redundancy that is limited temporally and functionally. The motivation of this research is to propose an effective approach to topology management under these constraints. Apparently flat structure is not suited to vehicular ad hoc networks since it is impossible for every node to acquire the global topology information. All participating nodes must be organized hierarchically so that only local information is required to exchange and global information is hidden for single node. Clustering is an important technique to implement hierarchical structure. Several heuristic clustering techniques have been proposed to choose cluster heads in an ad hoc network. These are lowest-ID, highest-degree and node-weight heuristics. However they cannot be deployed directly in ad hoc vehicular networks since their design objectives are not for highly mobility vehicular networks. The metrics used in these proposals are frequently changed. In this paper, we propose a new clustering technique, position-based hierarchical clustering, which incorporates position information into a novel hierarchical clustering technique. Each node knows its own position through a Global Positioning System. The cluster structure is determined by the geographic position of nodes. Each cluster has one node as the cluster head. Not only is the election of cluster heads based on nodes' position, but also the association and dissociation of clusters are determined by each node's position.- The predefined maximum distance between the cluster head and its members then controls the cluster size. It enables nodes to move during cluster setup and maintenance. Furthermore, it allows asynchronous operation for cluster head election. A vehicular ad hoc network can be considered as a one-dimension network by taking the number of lanes into account. We give some mathematical analysis about the performance under some assumptions. Our simulation results show that it gains better stability of the cluster structure, and needs smaller communication overhead for maintaining the cluster structure than the existing approaches do.","","0-7803-9000-8","","10.1109/WOCC.2005.1553789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553789","","Ad hoc networks;Collision avoidance;Communication networks;Intelligent transportation systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Nominations and elections;Road transportation;Spread spectrum communication","Global Positioning System;ad hoc networks;cellular radio;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network topology;vehicles","Global Positioning System;automotive ad hoc networks;cellular-relay architecture;heuristic clustering techniques;hybrid networks;intelligent transportation system;intervehicle communication;mobile ad hoc network;multihop wireless communications;position-based hierarchical clustering;topology management;vehicular ad hoc network","","","","0","","","","","20051219","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In early design phases, even when there is still uncertainty about the feasibility of the requirements, valuable information can be gained from models that describe the expected usage and the desired system reaction. The generation of test cases from these models indicates the feasibility of the intended solution and helps to identify scenarios for which the realization is hardly feasible or the intended system behavior is not properly defined. In this paper we present the formalization of requirements by models to simulate the expected field usage of a system. These so called usage models can be enriched by information about the desired system reaction. Thus, they are the basis for all subsequent testing activities: First, they can be used to verify the first implementation models and design decisions w.r.t. the fulfillment of requirements and second, test cases can be derived in a random or statistic manner. The generation can be controlled with operational profiles that describe different classes of field usage. We have applied our approach at a large German car manufacturer in the early development phase of active safety functionalities. Test cases were generated from the usage models to assess the implementation models in MATLAB/Simulink. The parametrization of the systems could be optimized and a faulty transition in the implementation models was revealed.

Additional limitations have been introduced in the Engine Control Unit to meet the continuously strengthened emission levels. Especially, for new engines these limitations lead to significant overshoots in the torque tracking which have to be prevented in any case. The limitations are studied and the impacts to the tracking are analyzed in this paper. The existing proportional-integral-controller is extended based on this analysis. In particular, the controller parameters are scheduled with respect to the change of the torque reference and the tracking error. No model of the plant is required for controller design, the controller parameters can be tuned quickly and easily during the set-up of a test bench.

This ability is becoming ever more crucial within embedded systems development, as a critical activity of testing, verification, validation and certification. However, semi-automatically or fully-automatically generating accurate trace links remains an open research challenge, especially for legacy systems. Vector Space Model (VSM), a notably known Information Retrieval (IR) technique aims to remedy this situation. However, VSM's low-accuracy level in practice is a limitation. The contribution of this paper is an improved VSM-based post-requirements trace ability recovery approach using a novel context analysis. Specifically, the analysis method can better utilize context information extracted from use cases to discover relevant source code files.

The stabilization strategy is based on two modules independent in design, a high level module that deals with the motion control objective and a low level module that deals with the actuator control allocation. The high level module consists of yaw-rate reference generator and high level controller that provides the low level control allocation module with a desired torque about the yaw axis. The task of the low level module is to command the individual brakes, the longitudinal clamping force, such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque. These commands are generated by a dynamic control allocation algorithm that also takes actuator constraints and uncertainty in the tyre-road friction model into consideration. Simulation cases where the tyre-road friction parameter was considered both known and unknown, show that the control scheme stabilizes the vehicle in extreme manoeuvres where the nonlinear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise becomes unstable in the sense of over-or under-steering","","0-9786720-1-1","0-9786720-0-3","10.1109/MED.2006.328748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4124853","","Actuators;Adaptive control;Automotive engineering;Friction;Heuristic algorithms;Motion control;Programmable control;Torque;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","actuators;automotive components;brakes;control system synthesis;friction;motion control;optimal control;road vehicles;stability;steering systems;vehicle dynamics","actuator control allocation;adaptive optimizing dynamic control allocation algorithm;automotive vehicle;brakes;low level control allocation module;motion control;nonlinear vehicle yaw dynamics;realistic nonlinear multibody vehicle simulation environment;tyre-road friction model uncertainty;yaw stabilization;yaw-rate reference generator","","","","6","","14","","","20070312","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The principal types of sensors are infrared sensors, pressure sensors, force and motion sensors, flow sensors, hydrophones, ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging, and material testing and temperature sensors. Several application fields are automotive, aerospace, communications, and environmental monitoring. Nonvolatile random access memories are another field of application. A conceptual understanding of switching dynamics for these devices is of scientific and technological interest and requires experiments to observe their static and dynamic behavior and to develop suitable models. In the field of measurement devices, for example, the design of sensors and actuators requires the use of efficient models. This emphasizes the need for both models and user friendly experimental setup allowing for the characterization of such classes of devices.

Furthermore, QFD techniques are used as tools to better focus on the application of these voltage regulators to the automotive industry and the cost of their implementations. Moreover, the present robust control approach allows us to deal with uncertainties and modelling errors in the switching regulator due to nonlinearities and changes in the operating conditions, neglected dynamics, components' tolerances, external disturbances, and so on.

The control purpose is to reproduce a specified acceleration profile at the shaker table close to the device under test (magnitude and frequency). The difficulty in sine testing is that the load dynamics are unknown and can severely modify the shaker response. Since a logarithmic frequency sweep is usually involved, the controller needs to be not only robust to unmodelled dynamics but also sufficiently fast to hold the specified magnitude acceleration within predefined limits during the sweep. In contrast to the typical frequency domain control approach of industrial shaker controllers, the proposed solution is implemented on a sample-by-sample basis, which reduces the time required to update the shaker drive signal in response to the controlled acceleration. A cascade of compensators is designed to attenuate the shaker structural resonances and obtain asymptotic reference tracking. The controller structure is developed based on the usual vibration testing power amplifier technology and on the typical frequency range of automotive and aerospace tests. A practical procedure is presented to identify the shaker dynamic model parameters and to design the acceleration controller. Different from other solutions presented in the literature for sine testing, the experimental performance is also investigated with resonant loads.","1751-8644","","","10.1049/iet-cta:20080188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4708681","","","acceleration control;dynamic testing;electrodynamics;time-domain analysis;vibration control","asymptotic reference tracking;digital acceleration controller;electrodynamic shaker;logarithmic frequency sweep;shaker response;sine vibration testing;time domain sinusoidal acceleration controller","","","","6","","","","","20081212","","IET","Institution of Engineering and Technology","IET Journals & Magazines"

FlexRay is designed to be faster and more reliable than the Controller Area Network (CAN) and The Time Triggered Protocol (TTP) in order to provide communication infrastructure for future generation high-speed control and safety critical applications, such as advanced powertrain, chassis and by-wire systems. Thus, there has been a lot of recent interest in timing analysis techniques in order to provide bounds for the message communication times on FlexRay. In this paper, we present an approach to check the schedulability and to compute the Worst Case Response Time (WCRT) for periodic and sporadic tasks, within a FlexRay node, responsible for sending messages on the Static Segment (SS) and Dynamic Segment (DS). On the other hand, we propose a scheduling table for messages transmitted over the FlexRay Static Segment. An interesting innovation would be the use of a scheduling algorithm performed on a FlexRay node to guarantee the arrival of the right data on the right time and to ensure that every task meets its deadline. In this paper, we will use as application an extended SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) benchmark for the FlexRay network to identify the static and dynamic tasks, and calculate the response time, based on a hybrid scheduling model to further prove that the deadline of the SAE benchmark applications is insured.","","978-1-4673-1949-2","","10.1109/ICCITechnol.2012.6285795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6285795","Fixed Scheduling;FlexRay;Periodic Tasks;SAE Benchmark;Worst Case Response Time","Benchmark testing;Dynamic scheduling;Protocols;Real time systems;Schedules;Scheduling algorithms;Time factors","automotive engineering;power transmission (mechanical);protocols;real-time systems;safety;scheduling","FlexRay bus;FlexRay static segment;by-wire system;chassis;dynamic segment;event triggered paradigm;extended society of automotive engineers benchmark;hard real time automotive system;hard real time distributed system;high-speed control;hybrid task scheduling;message communication time;message scheduling;periodic task;powertrain;safety critical application;scheduling algorithm;scheduling table;sporadic task;timing analysis technique;vehicular communication protocol;worst case response time","","","","0","","","","","20120827","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

After the product integration design is finalized, the Production Tool Design and Build (PTDB) processes becomes the VDP critical path. It is in the PTDB where virtual launch and validation activities are performed. To increase throughput of the engineering factory and reduce product development cost, we propose a research initiative in the area of Virtual Launch & Validation (VLV) of Manufacturing Automation Controls (MAC). VLV of MAC is composed of a series of PTDB launch and pre-launch activities in a virtual environment using physical, emulated, and simulated hardware and software. It encompasses the testing of MAC, its interactions with MAC analysis tools, and its interfaces with IT systems and related business processes. VLV of MAC also supports the development and testing of new IT systems and business processes as well as its hardware and software plant floor systems constituents. The mission of VLV of MAC is to minimize the duration of the launch and ramp up activities by reducing the implementation and execution times for plant floor systems and equipments via a priori system emulation, validation and testing. Based on our findings, we conclude that the most pressing needs for VLV of MAC lie in the thrust areas of object-oriented standard logic, auto-generation of virtual models, logic validation and system wide emulation. In summary, we conservatively estimate that a successful VLV of MAC implementation will reduce the VDP duration by several weeks hence providing automakers with savings in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per year.","","978-1-4244-5447-1","","10.1109/COASE.2010.5583977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5583977","","Computational modeling;Data models;Object oriented modeling;Production;Software;Solid modeling;Vehicles","automobile industry;factory automation;machine tools;product design;product development;virtual reality","IT system;MAC analysis tool;PTDB process;VDP critical path;automotive industry;business process;engineering factory;logic validation;manufacturing automation control;manufacturing engineering activity;object-oriented standard logic;plant floor system;product development cost;product integration design;production tool design and build;vehicle development process;virtual environment;virtual launch and validation;virtual model","","","","0","","45","","","20101021","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Transducers operating in the range from 400 to 1000°C are being applied in the power, process, automotive and aeroengine industries, as well as in materials research. To date, the majority of high temperature transducer designs have been based on adaptations of conventional single and dual-element probes for nondestructive testing (NDT). Such designs are outlined. It is noted, however, that the attempt to construct high temperature versions of conventional transducers has led to overcomplicated, expensive structures. In particular, they are modelled on probes used for scanning at ambient temperatures, although scanning is unlikely to be possible at high temperatures. An alternative approach is therefore described, based on the monolithic ultrasonic array structure. This offers not only lower transducer costs, but also full electronic control of the ultrasonic beam angle and emission point, thus facilitating inspection of a region within a test component using only one or two devices in fixed positions. Typical results demonstrating the beam-steering performance of the array, as well as those from B-scan time-of-flight testing, are presented. It is concluded that the problems of transducer development for ultrasonic, high-temperature NDT are not yet completely solved, and that further effort is required in the key areas of materials science and transducer structure.

Often, Electronic System-Level design tackles the challenge by simulation-based performance evaluation, although, the quality of system-level performance simulation approaches is not yet evaluated in detail. In this paper, we present the calibration and validation of a system-level performance simulation model. For evaluation, an automotive pedestrian detection algorithm is studied. Especially the varying number of pedestrians has a significant impact to the system performance and makes the prediction of execution time difficult. As test cases we used typical sequences and corner cases recorded by an experimental car.

IEEE","10-15 Oct. 2004","2004","","","361","368","Virtual prototyping is increasingly replacing real mock-ups and experiments in industrial product development. Part of this process is the simulation of structural and functional properties, which is in many cases based on finite element analysis (FEA). One prominent example from the automotive industry is the safety improvement resulting from crash worthiness simulations. A simulation model for this purpose usually consists of up to one million finite elements and is assembled from many parts, which are individually meshed out of their CAD representation. In order to accelerate the development cycle, simulation engineers want to be able to modify their FE models without going back to the CAD department. Furthermore, valid CAD models might even not be available in preliminary design stages. However, in contrast to CAD, there is a lack of tools that offer the possibility of modification and processing of finite element components while maintaining the properties relevant to the simulation. In this application paper we present interactive algorithms for intuitive and fast editing of FE models and appropriate visualization techniques to support engineers in understating these models. This includes new kinds of manipulators, feedback mechanisms and facilities for virtual reality and immersion at the workplace, e.g. autostereoscopic displays and haptic devices.","","0-7803-8788-0","","10.1109/VISUAL.2004.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372218","","Acceleration;Analytical models;Assembly;Automotive engineering;Design automation;Finite element methods;Product development;Safety;Vehicle crash testing;Virtual prototyping","CAD;automobile industry;automotive engineering;data visualisation;engineering graphics;finite element analysis;interactive systems;product development;virtual prototyping;virtual reality","CAD;automotive industry;autostereoscopy;data visualization;finite element models;industrial product development;interactive modification;manipulators;virtual prototyping;virtual reality","","","","0","","36","","","20050228","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of these systems are designed to perform in good weather conditions and they perform very poorly in adverse weather particularly in rain. A big problem related to rainy weather conditions that highly limits the performance of DAS is raindrops on car windshields. We present a novel approach that detects raindrops on a car windshield using only a single image from an in-vehicle camera and a standard interest point detector for pre-selection of raindrop candidates. The algorithm models the geometric shape of a raindrop on the car windshield, utilizes its photometric properties and establishes a relationship between raindrop and environment. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing machine vision-based approaches for the task of raindrop modeling and detection from an in-vehicle perspective. It functions very accurately and is robust in terms of imprecise positions of raindrop candidates. Its results can be further used for image restoration and vision enhancement and hence it is a valuable tool for DAS.","1931-0587","978-1-4244-3503-6","978-1-4244-3504-3","10.1109/IVS.2009.5164347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5164347","","Automotive components;Automotive engineering;Cameras;Construction industry;Detectors;Photometry;Rain;Robustness;Shape;Solid modeling","computational geometry;computer vision;driver information systems;image restoration","adverse weather condition;automotive industry;car windshields;geometric-photometric environment construction;image restoration;in-vehicle camera;intensity-based correlation;machine vision enhancement;photometric property;raindrop detection;raindrop modeling;rainy weather condition;vision-based driver assistance system","","","","9","","17","","","20090714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To test a whole vehicle early in its development would require the use of numerical electromagnetic modelling techniques.

The regulation of the slip acceleration at the lock-up is shown to reduce the undesired driveline oscillations. The critical standing start operating conditions are considered and numerical results show the good performance of the proposed controller","","0-7803-7061-9","","10.1109/.2001.980156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980156","","Automotive engineering;Diesel engines;Friction;Internal combustion engines;Mechanical power transmission;Piecewise linear techniques;Power system modeling;State-space methods;Torque;Vehicle dynamics","clutches;control system synthesis;feedback;piecewise linear techniques;road vehicles","LTI models;automotive driveline;automotive dry clutch;clutch disk speed;crankshaft speed;driveline oscillations;engine speed;feedback controller design;piecewise linear time-invariant models;second order model;slip acceleration regulation;slip control technique;slip speed;smooth engagement","","","","7","","","","","20020807","04 Dec 2001-07 Dec 2001","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two major advantages of this approach. First, the a priori knowledge of the evasion trajectory is explicitly incorporated into the computation of control inputs.

The electrode and the work piece must have electrical conductivity in order to generate the spark. The parts of aerospace, automotive industry and surgical components can be finished by EDM. The adequate selection of manufacturing conditions is one of the most important aspects to take into consideration in the die-sinking electrical discharge machining (EDM) of conductive materials, as these conditions are the ones that are to determine such important characteristics as: surface roughness and material removal rate, among others. In this work, a study was carried out on the influence of the factors of Current (I), pulse time (ti) and varied material over the listed technological characteristics.

These techniques are inherently dependent to the measurement devices, or sensors, operating properly. In particular, switched-reluctance-motor drives need position and current sensors to demonstrate full torque-control capability. This requirement yields more expensive and complex drive systems. On the other hand, when these sensors fail, the controller should be able to recover and handle the proper operation of the drive system. This fact necessitates back-up systems to support the operational drive in case of sensor failure, especially for life-dependent applications such as automotive systems. In the paper, novel virtual position and current sensors are designed based on modelling of magnetic double-saliency characteristics in switched-reluctance-motor drives. This approach does not suffer from unpredicted variations of spatial distribution of magnetic field since a practical autocalibration method is designed to tune the virtual sensors. The proposed virtual autocalibrating sensors are implemented fully on an experimental SRM drive based on a fixed-point digital signal processor.

The proposed analytical method enables projection of the end-customer demand information to upstream of the supply chain and estimate demand forecast at the individual tier levels. The supply chain performance assessment is based on the due-time performance metric (DTP - probability to ship a required product/parts volume in a fixed time interval) under the assumption of customer demand following a discrete time Markov process, a special case for correlated demands. A numerical case study demonstrates the use of the DTP measure for a two-tier supply chain. The analytical results (verified by simulations) quantify important relationships in the supply chain, involving reliabilities of machines/stations, capacities of the buffers, demands correlation, and the due times and find use in performance assessment, optimization and design of supply chains.","","0-7803-9519-0","","10.1109/WSC.2005.1574433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1574433","","Automotive engineering;Demand forecasting;Desktop publishing;Information analysis;Marine vehicles;Markov processes;Measurement;Performance analysis;Steady-state;Supply chains","Markov processes;demand forecasting;discrete time systems;supply chain management","automotive industry;demand forecasting;discrete time Markov process;due-time performance metric;end-customer demand information;performance mapping;steady-state behavior;supply chain performance assessment;upstream demand projection","","","","1","","12","","","20060123","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Emission control can be achieved either by controlling combustion or by treating the exhaust gas. The latter is comparatively easier since there is less or no need to modify the engine itself. One such after treatment method is the use of catalytic converter. But, the 3-way converter is expensive due to use of both platinum and palladium/rhodium. One of the alternative is the use of selective catalytic reduction, i.e., reduction of a particular mission based on the type of the engine used. For example, the major emissions in case of CI engines are NO<sub>X</sub> and PM. This project aims at reduction of NO<sub>X</sub> using SCR and its optimization. This project presents a modelling approach to the design optimization of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems. The present study is concerned with ammonia slip and conversion efficiency of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), which are two major issues of SCR technologies. The physical processes including urea spray atomization, droplet evaporation, urea decomposition and turbulent mixing are accounted for in the modelling method. In addition, the velocity distribution and pressure drop in the SCR converter are analyzed with the consideration of flow resistances of the catalyst substrates and perforated plates.","","978-1-4244-9081-3","","10.1109/FAME.2010.5714808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714808","","Combustion;Diesel engines;Exhaust systems;Fuels;Nitrogen;Thyristors","automobile industry;convertors;design engineering;diesel engines;exhaust systems;optimisation;substrates","3-way converter;DI diesel engine;SCR converter;SCR systems;automotive industry;catalyst substrates;catalytic converter;combustion;design optimization;droplet evaporation;emission characteristics;emission control;exhaust gas;flow resistance;modelling approach;nitrogen oxides;palladium;perforated plates;platinum;pressure drop;rhodium;selective catalytic reduction;turbulent mixing;urea decomposition;urea spray atomization;velocity distribution","","","","0","","5","","","20110217","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It's always used in automotive fields. Innovative design in driver circuits of white LED lamps with respect of functionality, efficiency, cost, size and reliability enables the successful introduction of new LED based lighting products. First of all, it describes LED's characteristics briefly which include electrical character, driver requirement, luminous characteristic, thermal performance and package structure. In the second part, a series connection of single LED cells is presented in detail. For efficiency reasons, white LED lamps can not be droved via series resistor, but need PWM models with current control. In the third part, different standard DC-DC converter topologies are discussed which can be adapted to feed a constant current into a LED load. Hence, roughly, it consists of two general types which named non-isolated driver and isolated driver separately. This paper will introduce more detailed classifications. It's convenient to choose proper driver circuit and suited components through the comparison between the topologies of this paper.

We consider the synthesis of an H<sub>∞</sub> robust controller and also the neurofuzzy approach. An optimized PID controller was also designed for the final analysis and evaluation. Based on Ackerman Geometry and the reading of the steering front angles, it was possible to estimate the maneuver radius from turning center. Thus, all three proposed control approaches must adjust the rear wheel's individual angular speeds by means of the current control of the two electrical motors linked to them, so that the car presents an appropriate behavior during all possible maneuvers.

Naturally, in the recent past, different techniques have been proposed to accelerate schedulability analysis algorithms, including parallel computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). However, applying traditional GPU programming methods in this context restricts the effective usage of on-chip memory and in turn imposes limitations on fully exploiting the inherent parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.

In particular, switched reluctance motor drives need position and torque sensors to demonstrate full torque control capability. This requirement yields to more expensive and complex drive system. On the other hand, when these sensors fail, the control system should compensate for the failure to function properly. This necessitates back up systems to support the operational drive in case of sensor failure especially for life dependent applications like automotive systems. In this paper, novel virtual position and torque sensors are designed based on modeling of magnetic double saliency characteristics in the switched reluctance motor drives. A practical auto-tuning method is designed to calibrate the virtual sensors. The proposed virtual auto-calibrating sensors are fully implemented on our experimental SRM drive based on TMS320LF2407 fixed-point digital signal processor.

"On the link between modularity and cost-a methodology to assess cost implications of product architecture differences","Fixson, S.K.; Clark, J.P.","","Engineering Management Conference, 2002. IEMC '02. 2002 IEEE International","2002","2002","1","","131","136 vol.1","Modularity has received renewed interest as a product design strategy to accommodate the competing goals of low cost and high levels of variety and flexibility. Modularity has been associated with numerous advantages for firms and customers, including faster product development, greater product variety, and allowing customers to customize products. However, there is a lack of clear understanding of the cost implications of modularity. One reason for this gap is the use of the term 'modularity' for similar, yet often slightly different, phenomena in different contexts, disciplines, and industries. Consequently, modularity is very difficult to operationalize. This paper presents a methodology to address this problem. Arguing that modularity is actually a bundle of product characteristics rather than a single dimension, the method proceeds in three steps. First, unbundling modularity into multiple dimensions of the product architecture allows one to comparatively measure the differences among products along the individual dimensions. Second, building on process-based cost modeling tools, a cost estimation procedure calculates the product costs for the selected life cycle or supply chain phases. The third step links the cost differences to individual product architecture differences. These links can improve the understanding of how individual dimensions of the product architecture affect different costs along the supply chain. A case study of automotive doors is used to demonstrate the methodology.","","0-7803-7385-5","","10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038379","","Buildings;Costs;Design engineering;Laboratories;Life estimation;Phase estimation;Product design;Product development;Supply chains;Systems engineering and theory","automobiles;costing;product development","automotive doors;cost estimation procedure;individual product architecture differences;life cycle;modularity;process-based cost modeling tools;product characteristics;product design strategy;product development;product variety;products customisation;supply chain","","","","1","","","","","20030709","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, there are many efforts to integrate their characteristic functionalities into one chip. As the power supply, power management, energy recuperation, RF communication, digital signal processing, memory, MEMS modules etc. are available and optimized in various fabrication technologies, the idea is to vertically integrate several dedicated IC-wafers. The simulations of the stand-alone modules functionality are insufficient to assure that the modules will work when assembled into a stacked device. Therefore, during the microstructures simulations it is necessary to take into consideration the interactions between the stacked modules. For integrated micro- and nanostructures the coupling between thermal, electrical and mechanical phenomena is a crucial issue. A temperature distribution due to Joule heating, combined with different thermal expansion coefficients of each layer, influences the mechanical and electrical parameters of the structure. Modeling of the coupled fields allows for analysis of most parameters of the microstructure (deflection, resistance changes etc.) and their dependence on temperature. Such results give crucial information to the designer about many aspects of the microsystem. At this stage of the design the technological sequence as well as materials used can be virtually verified and tested. In this paper we present the selected simulations results of the 3D models of the vertically integrated silicon dies.

Awareness of the environment that surrounds a vehicle can make driving and manoeuvring of the vehicle much safer for all road users. The authors present an image-processing method to detect lane departures using video taken from multiple optical cameras that is specifically designed to be in accordance with proposed automotive lane departure warning standards. This multi-camera system is more robust to errors caused by lane marking occlusions, sensor failure and glare that single camera systems can suffer from. The system uses a novel lane marking segmentation algorithm in accordance with international standards for lane markings. This method does not demand the high computational requirements of inverse perspective mapping (IPM) unlike methods proposed in related research. The authors present a method for lane boundary modelling based on subtractive clustering and Kalman filtering, which is within the constraints of automotive standards. Finally, using the cameras intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, the width of the vehicle and guidelines issued by the International Organisation for Standardisation, the authors show how lane departure can be identified. Results are presented that verify the system's high detection rate and robustness to various background interference, lighting conditions and road environments.","1751-956X","","","10.1049/iet-its.2011.0100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6279623","","","Kalman filters;image segmentation;image sensors;object detection;pattern clustering;traffic engineering computing","International Organisation for Standardisation;Kalman filtering;automotive environment;automotive lane departure warning standards;image sensors;image-processing method;inverse perspective mapping;lane boundary modelling;lane departure detection;lane marking occlusions;lane marking segmentation algorithm;multiple optical cameras;multiple-camera lane departure warning system;sensor failure;subtractive clustering","","","","0","","","","","20120823","","IET","Institution of Engineering and Technology","IET Journals & Magazines"

The implemented vision system detects the lane markings ahead of the vehicle, regardless of the varieties in road appearance, and determines the desired trajectory based on the relative positions of the vehicle with respect to the center of the road. To achieve more humanlike driving behavior such as smooth turning, particularly at high levels of speed, a fuzzy gain scheduling (FGS) strategy is introduced to compensate for the feedback controller for appropriately adapting to the SW command. Instead of manual tuning by trial and error, the methodology of FGS is designed to ensure that the closed-loop system can satisfy the crossover model principle.

Also discussed are results and possibilities of application in automotive industry; for distant measurements (hundreds of meters); and for some medical applications. Discussed are investigations of errors compensation. These errors take place because various objects have different size and shape, and they emit or reflect different amount of light. Without using of compensation the total error would be about hundreds of percent. So all errors were analyzed, classified, mathematically modeled and there were created special loops for errors compensation. As a result total error of measurement was less that 15% for all conditions of practical usage. During design and construction it was provided that the system can be applied for indoor and outdoor conditions. Special climatic testing has confirmed that.

The ""X"" in the X-by-wire is replaced by ""steer"", ""throttle"", and ""brake"" to represent the steer-by-wire, throttle-by-wire, and brake-by-wire systems. Common to all of these subsystems is that the operator control input device (i.e., steering column, acceleration pedal, and brake pedal) is not connected to the actuation devices mechanically. Rather, it is connected to an embedded computer which, in turn, sends the control signals to the actuation devices. Current state of art steering systems used in articulated vehicles are hydro-mechanical type systems, i.e., the steering column motion is transmitted and amplified by the main hydraulic circuit by hydro-mechanical means. This paper presents a new steer-by-wire (SBW) system which we designed, modeled, analyzed, and tested on wheel type loader construction equipment. The simulation results and tests conducted on a prototype development vehicle (a medium size wheel type loader) show very good agreement. The control algorithm is modeled using graphical modeling tools similar to Simulink and StateFlow. A real-time control algorithm is implemented on a Motorola 68332 microprocessor-based embedded controller. The operational performance of the steer-by-wire system has been convincingly demonstrated.","1083-4435","","","10.1109/TMECH.2005.859838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556572","Electro-hydraulic;X-by-wire;steer-by-wire (SBW);variable displacement pump","Acceleration;Art;Automotive applications;Circuit testing;Control systems;Embedded computing;Power system modeling;Vehicles;Wheels;Wires","brakes;control engineering computing;design engineering;electrohydraulic control equipment;real-time systems;road vehicles;steering systems;wires (electric)","Motorola 68332 microprocessor;Simulink;StateFlow;actuation power subsystem;articulated vehicle;brake-by-wire control systems;construction equipment;electrical wires;electrohydraulic system;embedded computer;graphical modeling tools;hydraulic circuit;hydromechanical type systems;real-time control algorithm;steer-by-wire control systems;steering column motion;steering systems;throttle-by-wire control systems;wheel type loader","","","","13","","13","","","20051212","","IEEE","ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The investigation is particularly focused on an electrical drive loading distributed electrical architecture, where diffused DC/DC power conversion is needed. The DC electrical drive, designed and realized in a prototypical form, is devoted to fuel pumping and it is formed by a 14 V DC motor and a DC/DC power converter from 42 V to 14 V. Suitable experimental measurement systems have been set up to measure electromagnetic conducted disturbances on 42 V vehicle power net and radiated emissions. A theoretic and experimental study on different solutions using different switching frequencies of DC/DC converter has been made in order to define the best compromise between the mitigation of electromagnetic emissions and the resulting reduction of filters size.

The most challenging task in designing antennas for SDARS (satellite digital audio radio services) is to satisfy a variety of requirements for automotive applications. Besides meeting the SDARS-antenna specification, styling conditions must be considered. For many vehicle models, the recommended mounting location to meet the required radiation pattern is considered inconvenient and there is a strong desire to design inconspicuous antennas. This constraint would cause intolerable high bit-error-rates resulting in too many interruptions in poor signal areas, even though multiple satellite signals and a terrestrial signal are made available at any time. Reduction of the bit-error-rate depends on the diversity efficiency describing the number of decorrelated antenna signals being made available, either from a multiport antenna at an appropriate location on a car or from a variety of dislocated inconspicuously arranged SDARS-antennas. On the basis of a variety of antenna-diversity arrangements, the estimated diversity efficiency is considered. Ways of correcting phase detection errors are also considered.","","0-7803-8302-8","","10.1109/APS.2004.1332063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1332063","","Antenna radiation patterns;Automotive applications;Decorrelation;Digital audio broadcasting;Mobile antennas;Phase detection;Radio broadcasting;Satellite antennas;Satellite broadcasting;Vehicles","antenna radiation patterns;digital audio broadcasting;direct broadcasting by satellite;diversity reception;error statistics;mobile antennas;mobile satellite communication","SDARS;automotive applications;bit-error-rates;bit-error-reduction;decorrelated antenna signals;diversity efficiency;mobile satellite digital broadcast reception;phase detection errors;radiation pattern;satellite digital audio radio services;switching antenna diversity","","","","1","","","","","20040913","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Solder joint reliability has been a critical issue of the overall design of microelectronic devices. However, the contribution of vibration to thermal fatigue life of solder joints has rarely been investigated. Vibration is taken as a loading case that only causes elastic material response. Literature is scarce on vibration plasticity and vibration caused fatigue. The standard practice in the industry is to use Miner's rule to calculate combined environment fatigue life. This study shows that using Miner's rule for fatigue life under combined loading is inaccurate. There are a number of models on thermomechanical behavior of solder joints, yet few models are verified by test data obtained from actual package size solder joints under realistic thermomechanical loading. The authors see the need of such tests for the purpose of better understanding of material behavior of solder joints under thermal and vibration loading and providing a solid basis for more accurate material modeling and fatigue life prediction. This paper reports observations from a series of concurrent thermal cycling and vibration tests on 63Sn/37Pb solder joints of an actual ball grid array (BGA) package. Moire interferometry (MI) is used to measure the inelastic deformation field of solder joints with submicron resolution, A large capacity Super AGREE thermal chamber and a high acceleration electrodynamic shaker is assembled together to perform the concurrent cycling.

However, a more robust machine, in terms of improved containment of the magnets, results when the magnets are buried inside the rotor, which, since it introduces a reluctance torque, also serves to reduce the back-emf, the iron loss and the inverter voltage rating.

The Saab Gripen fighter aircraft, together with simulators in which the aircraft behavior, performance, and handling qualities are represented, is used to exemplify application. Integration principles of the systems for simulator configuration, Software Configuration Management, and Product Data Management (PDM) are studied. Preliminary results show that a configurator tool can be used, but there is need to map structures between the simulation and PDM domains.","1524-4547","978-1-4577-0134-4","978-0-7695-4410-6","10.1109/WETICE.2011.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990025","Configurator;MBSE;Product Line;Simulation","Aerospace electronics;Aircraft;Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Software","aerospace computing","Saab Gripen fighter aircraft;aircraft behavior;collaborative simulator development;configuration support;configurator prototype system;early design evaluation;knowledge capture;multipurpose models;product data management;product lifecycle;product line context;secondary product line;simulation models;software configuration management;system verification;user training","","","","0","","21","","","20110818","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

System simulation, therefore, requires an approach that includes switch arc behavior. A technique for employing a well-known equation from power circuit breaker design to analyze such arc-circuit interaction for switch arcs of less than 2 mm in length is described. The so-called Mayr arc equation provides a basis for accurate modeling of arc-circuit instability after one recognizes that the drawn switch arc exists in two distinct phases, for which the mechanisms of arc erosion and instability are effectively decoupled. This approach provides a technique for predicting instabilities in switched automotive electrical systems that could result in either radiofrequency interference to vehicle electronics, or potentially damaging high voltage transients","0018-9545","","","10.1109/25.385928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=385928","","Circuit breakers;Circuit simulation;Frequency;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear equations;Power system modeling;Surges;Switches;Switching circuits;Vehicle dynamics","arcs (electric);automotive electronics;circuit breakers;circuit oscillations;circuit-breaking arcs;load (electric);overvoltage;power system transients;radiofrequency interference;switching circuits","DC automotive switching;Mayr arc equation;application;arc erosion;arc-circuit instability;circuit breaker;current chopping;dynamic arc;inductive load;modeling;nonlinear response;oscillations;radiofrequency interference;simulation;transient overvoltages;vehicle electronics","","","","2","","8","","","20020806","","IEEE","IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For an automotive application, such as a DC-DC converter that interconnects the high voltage battery or ultra-capacitor in a hybrid electrical vehicle (HEV) or a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) to the DC-link, costs and failure rate are likewise of importance. Due to increasing requirements on multiple of these converter characteristics the comprehensive multi-objective optimization of the entire converter system gains importance. Thereto, this paper proposes an optimization method to explore the limits of power density as a function of the switching frequency and the number of phases of non-isolated bi-directional multi-phase DC-DC converters operated with soft-switching and silicon devices and hard-switched converters that take advantage of SiC devices. In addition, the optimization includes an algorithm to determine the chip size required for the semiconductor devices under consideration of the thermal characteristics and efficiency requirements.

"Why feature dependencies challenge the requirements engineering of automotive systems: An empirical study","Vogelsanag, A.; Fuhrmann, S.","Inst. fur Inf., Tech. Univ.

To overcome these problems, many approaches exist that focus on modeling these functional dependencies in early stages of system design. However, there are only few empirical studies that report on the extent of such dependencies in industrial software systems and how they are considered in an industrial development context. In this paper, we analyze the functional architecture of a real automotive software system with the aim to assess the extent, awareness and importance of interactions between features of a future vehicle. Our results show that within the functional architecture at least 85% of the analyzed vehicle features depend on each other. They furthermore show that the developers are not aware of a large number of these dependencies when they are modeled solely on an architectural level. Therefore, the developers mention the need for a more precise specification of feature interactions, e.g., for the execution of comprehensive impact analyses. These results challenge the current development methods and emphasize the need for an extensive modeling of features and their dependencies in requirements engineering.","","","","10.1109/RE.2013.6636728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636728","Functional specifications;automotive;empirical studies;feature interaction;model-based development","Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Interviews;Software systems;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","automotive engineering;formal specification;software architecture","automotive software system;feature interactions;functional architecture;functional dependencies;impact analyses;industrial development;industrial software systems;requirements engineering","","","","0","","","","","20131021","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Path planning is a necessary and fundamental technology for AUV autonomy, its goal is to search an optimized path according to some optimization criteria in a certain environment and makes AUV fulfill its mission objectives along the collision-free path. Based on the theory and the application of GA, This work presents a global path planning method for AUV based on GA and domain knowledge in a large-scale chart. The grid method is adopted to set up a discrete space model for path planning based on known chart data, and each data structure of a grid stores some property such as digital elevation, permit and so on. A kind of decimal grid-coordinate coding scheme which adopting a variable length chromosome encoding is presented. The generating method of initial population, the fitness evaluation function, the evolve strategy and some superiority genetic operators are all designed and introduced in detail. And some measures are also adopted to improve the searching capability and to speed up convergence of the algorithm. The planning results show that the GA path planner has some advantages such as more stronger ability for searching a global optimized and viable path, efficiency superiority, convergence rapidly, path described more simply and perspicuous. The GA path planner based on domain knowledge becomes an important element of AUV autonomy ability and can be potentially applied as an on-line path planner for AUV.","","0-7803-8669-8","","10.1109/OCEANS.2004.1406356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1406356","","Automotive engineering;Biological cells;Convergence;Data structures;Encoding;Genetics;Large-scale systems;Marine technology;Path planning;Underwater vehicles","collision avoidance;genetic algorithms;oceanographic techniques;remotely operated vehicles;underwater vehicles","AUV;GA path planner;autonomous underwater vehicle;collision-free path;decimal grid-coordinate coding;discrete space model;domain knowledge;genetic algorithm;genetic operators;grid method;large-scale chart;marine engineering;oceanography research;on-line path planner;path optimization;path planning;variable length chromosome encoding","","","","0","","","","","20050314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most real optical systems will introduce some undesirable effects, rendering the assumption of the pin-hole camera model invalid. By far the most evident of these effects is radial distortion, particularly in fish-eye camera systems where the level of this distortion is relatively extreme. The aim of fish-eye distortion correction is, therefore, to transform the distorted view of fish-eye cameras to the desired rectilinear pin-hole perspective view. To perform this distortion correction, several authors have developed models of fish-eye distortion. It is the aim of this paper to examine the accuracy of several of the polynomial-based models against the equidistance mapping function, which is the most common mapping function that fish-eye lenses are designed to follow.","","","","10.1049/cp.2009.1700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524697","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20100812","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

A HWIL simulator consists of a subset of hardware from a real object interfaced to a control system, with the goal of matching the closed loop behaviour of the simulator to that of the complete object. The simulator design problem is qualitatively different from the standard control design problem; while classical control design aims to reduce uncertainty in plant behaviour, controllers in HWIL simulators must instead match simulator behaviour to the behaviour of the real object, which are both sensitive to the underlying uncertainty in the hardware. This represents a new design challenge that has not yet been addressed in the literature. The design method presented here is general and non-heuristic, and is applicable to a large class of uncertain, non-linear systems. The method is based on the computation of a sub-optimal solution to an optimisation over the space of possible controllers.

Active flutter suppression (AFS) is a considerable solution to this issue. Sliding mode control (SMC) method, a nonlinear control strategy, is applied to AFS of a typical two-dimensional airfoil in this work. The airfoil has a trailing-edge flap utilized for flutter control. The system involves a two-DOF (degree-of-freedom) motion whose equations are constructed by using quasi-steady aerodynamic forces. First, the AFS system is designed by state feedback SMC method to suppress the flutter. Then, a sliding mode observer (SMO) is incorporated for further improvements. Finally, classical Runge-Kutta (RK) algorithm is utilized for simulations. The results indicate that the SMO can estimate the system states fast. Combining with the SMO, the controller could suppress the flutter at 14.8% above the open-loop flutter boundary.","","978-1-4244-6043-4","978-1-4244-7505-6","10.1109/ISSCAA.2010.5633472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633472","","Aerodynamics;Aircraft;Atmospheric modeling;Automotive components;Equations;Mathematical model;State feedback","Runge-Kutta methods;aerodynamics;aerospace components;aircraft control;motion control;nonlinear control systems;stability;state feedback;variable structure systems","AFS;Runge-Kutta algorithm;SMO;active flutter suppression;aircraft;degree-of-freedom;dynamic instability;nonlinear control;quasi-steady aerodynamic forces;sliding mode control;sliding mode observer;state feedback SMC method;two-DOF motion;two-dimensional airfoil","","","","0","","19","","","20101111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hierarchical dependability model allows expressing multiple redundancies made at multiple levels of a system decomposed to multiple cooperating blocks. A hierarchical dependability model based on Markov chains allows each block and relations between these blocks to be expressed independently by Markov chains. This allows a decomposition of a complex dependability model into multiple small models to be made. The decomposed model is easier to read, understand and modify. A hazard rate is calculated significantly faster using hierarchical model, because the decomposition allows exponential calculation-time explosion to be avoided. The paper shows a method how to reduce Markov chains and use them to create hierarchical dependability models. An example study is used to demonstrate the advantages of the hierarchical dependability models (the decomposition of the complex model into multiple simple models and the speedup of the hazard rate calculation).","","978-1-4799-0595-9","","10.1109/LATW.2013.6562660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562660","","","Markov processes;hazards;hierarchical systems;safety-critical software","Markov chains;casualties;hazard state;hierarchical dependability models;injuries;multiple cooperating blocks;safety","","","","0","","8","","","20130718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Complex, embedded real-time control systems typically have a very large grain task model upon which hard and soft timing constraints are simultaneously imposed. Often, such systems are required to function in extremely hostile and unpredictable environments. This demands large dependability and availability in a continuous manner We describe a new paradigm to build such systems which is based on the notion of paths-the granularity at which the notion of time is expressed in software. Further the paper describes distributed middleware services that are being developed to provide dependable, adaptive dynamic resource management. To illustrate the approach, an automobile air bag control system is used as an application example. Path descriptions can be applied in system design or system maintenance and during run time optimization. Within this framework, model based evaluation is often required. Therefore, in the second part of the paper a modeling approach for paths based on Stochastic Petri Nets is described, and results of a performance evaluation are presented","","0-8186-7889-5","","10.1109/ECBS.1997.581928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581928","","Availability;Buildings;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Distributed control;Middleware;Real time systems;Scalability;Timing;Vehicle dynamics","Petri nets;automotive electronics;control system synthesis;control systems;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;performance evaluation;real-time systems;systems engineering","Stochastic Petri Nets;automobile air bag control system;dependability;distributed;distributed middleware;embedded;embedded real-time control systems;real-time control systems;scalability","","","","4","","8","","","20020806","24 Mar 1997-28 Mar 1997","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These sequences can be used as test cases to the end of both validating the model and also verifying an actual system. In the automotive domain, many systems are reactive and exhibit continuous as well as discrete dynamics. This leads to an explosion of the model state space, which makes automated test case generation difficult, and because of imprecisions in the continuous parts, requires an adequate treatment of fuzziness both in the dimensions of time and values. We report on experiments with model-based testing in the automotive domain. Roughly, the idea is to use two separate models, a discrete model as an abstract description of relevant scenarios, and a discrete-continuous model to produce reference outputs for the actual system. As an application example we use a fictitious autonomous cruise control system (ACC). We argue that rapid prototyping approaches fit well with the use of models that serve as specifications, as a basis for test case generation, or as a basis for production code generation.","1074-6005","0-7695-1943-1","","10.1109/IWRSP.2003.1207033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207033","","Automatic testing;Automotive engineering;Concrete;Control systems;Design engineering;Mathematical model;Prototypes;System testing;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicle dynamics","automotive engineering;continuous time systems;control system analysis computing;discrete time systems;formal specification;road traffic;traffic control","automated test case generation;automotive domain;autonomous cruise control system;behavior model;discrete model;hybrid reactive systems;mixed discrete-continuous model;model state space;model-based testing;production code generation;prototype-based tests;rapid prototyping;specifications;test case generation","","","","1","","","","","20030625","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of HEV control is in fact to find out the sequence of optimal power splits at each instant of time that minimizes the fuel consumption over a given driving schedule. Big obstacles to the control design are the model complexity and the necessity of ""a priori"" knowledge of torque and velocity profiles.

It represents the rod jammed on one hand which is attached by the other end face to the cylinder rotating on a support. For reduction of a rod into position the support moves on some distance in the direction of closing up. Thus the rod loses stability and deviates the equilibrium rectilinear form. At work vibro-protecting systems loading on a rod is transferred as the moment on the right support. At some value of the enclosed moment the rod can lose stability again. The problem of calculation dependence - a moment - corner of turn - on the right support is put. This dependence is necessary for the adjustment of the vibro-protecting mechanism and for the selection of parameters of the proof-reader of rigidity, and the ""falling"" site of this dependence is most interesting. In [(Levin, VE, 2000), (Pustovoy, NV, 2003)] the algorithm of calculation of deformation of a curvilinear core resulted on the basis of the nonlinear equations and use of a method of shooting. In the same place, the example calculation of a part of the diagram - the moment - a corner of turn for the real mechanism is shown.

Such an integration is critical for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) when model parts are independently developed by different teams as it is the case in multi-tier industries, e.g. avionics and automotive. Analysis algorithms play a central role augmenting the designer's capacity to automatically verify properties of interest in systems at the scale and complexity required by these industries. Unfortunately, the verification results are valid only if the assumptions of the different analysis algorithms (analytic assumptions) are consistent with each other. This paper presents our work on the automatic verification of one important class of analytic assumptions in OAR models: resource allocation assumptions. These assumptions are modeled as Resource Allocation (RA) contracts. RA contract constructs include not only the typical assumes and guarantees but also runtime facts and implications. Finally, we automatically determine the correct sequence of execution of the analysis algorithms based on the contract input/output dependencies described in our models. Together these characteristics enable the automatic assumption verification that preserves the scalability of analytic models. We illustrate our approach using an example model with analysis algorithms for security, schedulability, and energy efficiency.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064507","AADL;Assumption management;Cyber-Physical Systems;Design by Contract;Resource Allocation","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Contracts;Mathematical model;Resource management;Runtime;Unified modeling language","formal verification;resource allocation;scheduling;security of data;software architecture","CPS;OAR models;RA contracts;analysis algorithms;analytic assumptions;analytic interpretations;automatic assumption verification;automatic verification;cyber-physical systems;designers capacity;energy efficiency;multitier industry;open analytic runtime models;resource allocation assumptions;resource allocation contracts;runtime architectural models;runtime facts;schedulability;security","","","","0","","","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results showed that element compressive force increased with torque ratio and decreased with transmission ratio. Band tensile force decreased with time when i<;1, while increased when i≥1. The friction force between belt band and element increased with time. The band pack and the belt element differ from each other, which may cause transmission loss in different stage as the belt traverses the pulley wraps.

Some practitioners have initiated concentrated efforts to reengineer their development processes as to move (or “load”) their problem identification and solution backwards in time (to the “front” of the process). In this paper, we provide a conceptual model and some case evidence from development practice to describe the basic principle behind this rapidly emerging concept. We base our discussion on a problem solving perspective of product development. We describe and analyze a product development project as a bundle of inter-dependent problem-solving cycles that include modeling and testing via computers or physical prototypes as core activities. Using this perspective, we propose that the earlier identification and solving of a set of problems for a given developmental task can lead to faster and more efficient product development. Our evidence is mostly case-based but we feel it points towards the emergence of an important capability for improving development practice. The paper addresses the following issues: we start with a brief discussion of the benefits and potential risks of shortening product development. We then describe the problem-solving perspective of product development and apply it to automotive development. The next sections explain the basic principle of front-loading which is followed by a field study of front-loading at Toyota Motor Corporation. We conclude the paper with implications for managerial practice and research","","1-890843-02-4","","10.1109/PICMET.1999.807965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807965","","Acceleration;Computer aided engineering;Design engineering;Disaster management;Financial management;Problem-solving;Product development;Project management;Prototypes;Testing","automobile industry;management;product development","Toyota Motor Corporation;automotive development;conceptual model;development performance;front-loading problem-solving;inter-dependent problem-solving cycles;managerial practice;problem identification;problem solution;problem solving perspective;product development;research","","","","0","","","","","20020806","25 Jul 1999-29 Jul 1999","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Historically, HDL-based design courses have been taught mostly at the graduate level. Undergraduate courses have mainly emphasized the principles of digital systems design, at both the logic and architectural levels. The laboratory component of these courses often introduces the students to graphical design capture tools and their associated simulators. However, within the past few years industry has been moving away from graphical design captures and is more openly adopting HDL-based design methodologies. Based on these industry shifts, one can easily conclude that HDLs are becoming an integral part of the design automation environments; this in turn requires the updating of the curricula, either by incorporating new courses or by updating existing ones. Specifically, courses that introduce undergraduates to HDLs in general and a standard language such as VHDL or Verilog are becoming essential in preparing future engineers. This paper discusses an HDL-based design course offered at Northern Arizona University (NAU). The course is used as a vehicle to introduce NAU students to the underlying concepts behind modeling, simulating, and verifying-digital systems design using hardware description languages.","0018-9359","","","10.1109/13.883357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883357","","Automotive engineering;Design automation;Design methodology;Digital systems;Electrical engineering;Fabrication;Hardware design languages;Laboratories;Logic design;Process design","CAD;computer science education;educational courses;hardware description languages","AHPL;CAD tools;USA;VHDL;curricula;design automation environments;graphical design capture tools;hardware description languages course;hardware design process;students;university design courses","","","","3","","14","","","20020806","","IEEE","IEEE Education Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Air flow rate, ambient air temperature, voltage, and device switching frequency were studied parametrically by performing transient and steady-state simulations. The transient simulations were based on inverter current that represents the US06 supplemental federal test procedure from the US EPA. The results demonstrate the thermal feasibility of using air to cool a cylindrical-shaped 55-kW SiC traction drive inverter with axial-flow of air. When the inverter model is subject to one or multiple current cycles, the maximum device temperature does not exceed 164°C (327°F) for an inlet flow rate of 270 cfm, ambient temperature of 120°C, voltage of 650 V, and switching frequency of 20 kHz. The results show that the ideal blower power input for the entire inverter with a total inlet air flow rate of 540 cfm is 312 W.","","978-1-4577-0542-7","","10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064080","","Atmospheric modeling;Heating;Inverters;Junctions;Silicon carbide;Steady-state;Transient analysis","cooling;invertors;traction motor drives;transient analysis","SiC devices;US EPA;US06 supplemental federal test;air cooled invertor;air flow rate;ambient air temperature;automotive traction drive;device switching frequency;power 312 W;power 55 kW;steady-state simulations;transient simulations","","","","1","","9","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design flow of such architectures consists of specifying control applications as Simulink/Stateflow models, followed by generating code from them and finally mapping such code onto multiple ECUs. In addition, the scheduling policies and parameters on both the ECUs and the communication buses over which they communicate also need to be specified. These policies and parameters are computed from high-level timing and control performance constraints. The proposed tutorial will cover different aspects of this design flow, with a focus on timing and schedulability problems. After reviewing the basic concepts of worst-case execution time analysis and schedulability analysis, we will discuss the differences between meeting timing constraints (as in classical real-time systems) and meeting control performance constraints (e.g., stability, steady and transient state performance). We will then describe various control performance related schedulability analysis techniques and how they may be tied to model-based software development. Finally, we will discuss various schedule synthesis techniques, both for ECUs as well as for communication protocols like FlexRay, so that control performance constraints specified at the model-level may be satisfied. Throughout the tutorial different commercial as well as academic tools will be discussed and demonstrated.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064501","Control Applications;Distributed Automotive Systems;Schedulability Analysis;Timing Analysis","Automotive engineering;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Control systems;Real time systems;Software;Timing","actuators;automobiles;automotive electronics;digital simulation;distributed control;real-time systems;scheduling;sensors;software engineering;timing","FlexRay;Simulink model;Stateflow model;actuator;communication buses;communication protocol;control performance constraints;design flow;distributed automotive control application;electronic control units;high-end cars;high-level timing;meeting timing constraints;model-based software development;real-time system;schedulability analysis;sensor;timing problem;worst-case execution time analysis","","","","0","","","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The equations of motion are then programmed by MATLAB, transferred into C++ code in the MIDEVA environment, and further developed into a motion platform control program by C++Builder. To achieve the simulator functions, a motion platform that is constructed by five hydraulic cylinders is designed, and its kinetics/inverse kinetics analysis is also conducted. Driver operation signals such as steering wheel angle, accelerator pedal, and brake pedal positions are measured to trigger the vehicle dynamics calculation and further actuate the cylinders by the motion platform control program.

A secondary cooling system is required to maintain an 85degC base plate temperature for silicon based power electronics; but by creating a silicon carbide (SiC) based replacement this requirement could be relaxed. One anticipated benefit, among many, is that the secondary cooling loop could be eliminated and instead interfaced with the engine coolant system designed to maintain a maximum temperature of 105degC. The purpose of this paper is to present an all-SiC scaled prototype that is modeled after the DC-DC converter used in the Prius II to establish a high voltage DC bus interconnecting the motor and generator. The design uses a SiC JFET and SiC Schottky diode as the switching pair of a 1 kW scale model that investigates an inherently safe approach for use in future HEVs. The ability to parallel these unipolar devices results in a scalable device technology capable of achieving high-current, 600-V SiC switch technology in the near term that offers a potential 100degC increase in junction temperature above that rated for comparable silicon IGBTs","","0-7803-9547-6","","10.1109/APEC.2006.1620578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620578","","Coolants;DC-DC power converters;Electronics cooling;Engines;Hybrid electric vehicles;Power electronics;Prototypes;Silicon carbide;Switches;Temperature","DC-DC power convertors;Schottky diodes;automotive electronics;hybrid electric vehicles;junction gate field effect transistors;power semiconductor devices;semiconductor device models;silicon compounds","100 C;600 V;85 C;DC/DC converters;JFET;Schottky diode;SiC;high voltage DC bus;hybrid electric vehicles;scalable SiC device;unipolar devices","","","","6","","4","","","20060418","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, analog circuit behaviors are so tightly intertwined with their environment that: 1) abstractions needed for model-based design are often not accurate, thus making it difficult to achieve reliable system performance estimations, and 2) generic, design-independent interfaces that are needed to develop compositional techniques are very difficult to define. In this paper, we propose a platform-based design methodology that uses analog contracts to develop reliable abstractions and design-independent interfaces. A contract explicitly handles pairs of properties, representing the assumptions on the environment and the promises of a component under these assumptions. Horizontal contracts encode composition rules that constrain how library elements should be “legally” used. Vertical contracts define under which conditions an aggregation of components satisfies the requirements posed at a higher level of abstraction. If both sets of contracts are satisfied, we can produce implementations by composition and refinement that are correct by construction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the design of an ultra-wide band receiver used in an Intelligent Tire system, an on-vehicle wireless sensor network for active safety applications.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2012.2211098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6259825","Analog and mixed-signal design;automotive sensor interfaces;contract-based design;integrated sensor interface modeling;platform-based design;ultrawideband","Analog circuits;Computational modeling;Contracts;Integrated circuit modeling;Libraries;Mathematical model;Optimization","analogue integrated circuits;automotive electronics;integrated circuit design;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;performance evaluation;radio receivers;road safety;software architecture;tyres;ultra wideband communication;wireless sensor networks","active safety applications;analog circuit behaviors;analog contracts;analog integrated interface design;composition rules;compositional methods;design-independent interfaces;horizontal contracts;intelligent tire system;library elements;model-based design;model-based development;on-vehicle wireless sensor network;platform-based design methodology;reliable abstractions;reliable system performance estimation;ultra-wide band receiver design;vertical contracts","","","","1","","66","","2012-08-03","20121016","","IEEE","IEEE Sensors Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the FlexRay specification misses to define such a service. Consequently, it is not a part of the communication controllers but has to be realized in the software that is executed by the ECUs. This paper proposes a membership protocol especially tailored for FlexRay-based distributed systems such as envisioned by the AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) standard.

"A project-based approach to teaching research writing to nonnative writers","Levis, J.M.; Levis, G.M.","English Dept., Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA, USA","Professional Communication, IEEE Transactions on","Sept. 2003","2003","46","3","210","220","It is commonly accepted that writing instruction should meet the specific needs of writers and that students in scientific and technical fields benefit more by learning to write to match the requirements of their specific fields. A variety of models for writing classes have been proposed to meet these needs, from genre-based approaches to courses targeting specific disciplines to general courses serving a heterogeneous group of students from many disciplines. Although persuasive arguments can be made for discipline-specific writing courses, many writing courses for nonnative writers at U.S. universities operate with two key constraints. First, monetary and curricular limitations mean that students from a variety of disciplines are placed in the same course. Second, these courses are staffed by instructors who, while well-prepared in addressing language needs of nonnative writers, may know very little about the content and conventions of engineering and science. This paper discusses a writing course which works within these constraints and has been developed for graduate students who are early in their program of study. In the course, groups of students carry out an original research project as a vehicle to learn professional writing conventions common to research papers in a variety of scientific and engineering fields.

However, it is difficult to design an effective controller to deal well with the inherent nonlinearity of the plant, such as the strong nonlinear effects of friction and return spring. In this paper, taking these factors into consideration, a controller is proposed: a nonlinear feedforward control is carried out in consideration of the system nonlinearities based on flatness, a linear feedback control is given to handle the uncertainties and disturbances. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller and its strong robustness to model uncertainties. Finally, the real time performance of the designed controller is tested by the Hardware in the Loop (HiL) platform based on xPC-Target.

Simplification of the prediction model used for the MPC reduces the memory requirement for implementation. We neglect the effects of variable cam timing in the prediction model, and instead, these effects are considered through a robustness analysis of the MPC to system variability. We compare two methods to achieve offset-free reference tracking, namely, the use of an integrator with actuator-saturation-based anti-windup logic, and the use of a Kalman filter to estimate plant-model mismatches. Evaluation of these methods for a vehicle acceleration scenario demonstrates advantages with using the Kalman-filter-based approach in the presence of system variability.","0743-1619","978-1-4799-0177-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6580159","","Actuators;Atmospheric modeling;Engines;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Turbines;Valves","Kalman filters;automotive components;control system synthesis;fuel systems;internal combustion engines;predictive control;pressure control;stability","Kalman filter;MPC robustness analysis;actuator-saturation-based anti-windup logic;automotive companies;boost pressure control;engine airflow;integrator;linear model predictive control;model predictive controller design;offset-free reference tracking;plant-model mismatch estimation;system variability;throttle actuation;throttle control;turbocharged gasoline engine air-path control;turbocharger wastegate actuation;vehicle acceleration scenario;wastegate control","","","","0","","21","","","20130815","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the design of a fully-integrated angular speed sensor system based on a capacitive carrier frequency measurement principle. To optimize the performance, we combined a synchronous demodulation strategy with an external resonance filter serving both as clock reference and noise protection. This filter was extended by an additional low-pass easing implementation of the demodulator and compensating for internal signal delays. For system simulation, a simple analytical model based on Fourier synthesis was found to be superior to a conventional SPICE simulation.

Final Program and Abstracts., IEEE/ASME International Conference on","20-20 June 1997","1997","","","105","","Summary form only given. The synergetic integration of mechanical processes, microelectronics and information processing opens new possibilities for process design as well as for automatic control. The solution of tasks within mechatronic systems is performed on the process side and the digital-electronic side. As the interrelations during the design play an important role, engineering must be simultaneous from the very beginning. Mechatronic systems are developed for mechanical elements, machines, vehicles and precision mechanic devices. The integration of mechatronic systems can be performed by the components (hardware-integration) and by information processing (software-integration). The information processing consists of low-level and high-level feedback control, supervision and diagnosis and general process management. Special signal processing, model based and adaptive methods are applied. With the aid of a knowledge base and inference mechanisms mechatronic systems with increasing intelligence will be developed. The main goals are to increase systems performance, reliability and economy, and production costs. Some examples for the development of mechatronic systems are shown, e.g. active damping of oscillations of mechanical drives, hydraulic pipes and vehicle suspensions, control of machine tools with force reconstruction, smart actuators and supervision and fault diagnosis for automobiles.","","0-7803-4080-9","","10.1109/AIM.1997.652972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=652972","","Automatic control;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Design engineering;Information processing;Intelligent actuators;Mechatronics;Microelectronics;Process design;Vehicles","automobiles;feedback;inference mechanisms;intelligent control;mechatronics;model reference adaptive control systems;signal processing","adaptive methods;automobiles;diagnosis;hardware-integration;high-level feedback control;inference mechanisms;information processing;knowledge base;low-level feedback control;machines;mechanical processes;mechatronic systems;microelectronics;model-based methods;process management;signal processing;software-integration;supervision;synergetic integration","","","","1","1","","","","20020806","16 Jun 1997-20 Jun 1997","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of such electric noise of the motor are produced by electro-magnetic exciting force and it is amplified to meet resonance frequency of system. Based on these faces, two kinds of method to reduce noise and vibration of system can be considered. The one is reduction of electro-magnetic exciting force.

Fog fades the colors and reduces the contrasts in the scene with respect to their distances from the driver. Various camera-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be improved if efficient algorithms are designed for visibility enhancement in road images. The visibility enhancement algorithm proposed in [1] is not optimized for road images. In this paper, we reformulate the problem as the inference of the local atmospheric veil from constraints. The algorithm in [1] thus becomes a particular case. From this new derivation, we propose to better handle road images by introducing an extra constraint taking into account that a large part of the image can be assumed to be a planar road. The advantages of the proposed local algorithm are the speed, the possibility to handle both color and gray-level images, and the small number of parameters. A new scheme is proposed for rating visibility enhancement algorithms based on the addition of several types of generated fog on synthetic and camera images. A comparative study and quantitative evaluation with other state-of-the-art algorithms is thus proposed. This evaluation demonstrates that the new algorithm produces better results with homogeneous fog and that it is able to deal better with the presence of heterogeneous fog. Finally, we also propose a model allowing to evaluate the potential safety benefit of an ADAS based on the display of defogged images.","1939-1390","","","10.1109/MITS.2012.2189969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190796","","Atmospheric measurements;Automotive engineering;Hazards;Inference algorithms;Road accidents;Road safety;Road vehicles;Terrestrial atmosphere;Vehicles","cameras;driver information systems;fog;image colour analysis;image enhancement;road accidents;road safety;road vehicles;visibility","ADAS;camera image;camera-based advanced driver assistance system;color image;defogged image;gray-level image;heterogeneous fog;homogeneous fog;local atmospheric;planar road;road image;safety benefit;speed;synthetic image;vehicle accident;visibility enhancement algorithm;vision enhancement","","","","2","","","","","20120426","","IEEE","IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The main reason is conventional front light do not provide sufficient and reasonable illumination for nighttime visibility to be adapted to curves.

Because vehicles' movement was related to complex dynamics, firstly linear two-degrees-freedom turning model and lateral role model of vehicles were studied. On the basis of these models, this paper put forward control algorithm of adaptive front light on curve roads. From the research, it was concluded that horizontal swing angles of vehicles' front light on curve roads were adjusted according to drivers' visual angle change with velocity change, front wheels' swing angle and side-slip angle, and vertical swing angles of vehicles' front light on curve roads was adjusted according to lateral roll angle of the vehicle' body, and longitudinal irradiation distance of vehicles' front light on curve roads was controlled by safe stopping distance of vehicles.

For this reason, voltage stability has become an important criterion in the design process of a power net. Beside the electrical power steering, the electro hydraulic breaking systems is one of the critical systems regarding peak power consumption. In this paper, a dynamic model of an electromechanical actuator for an automotive breaking system is presented. The model is validated by comparison of simulation and measurement from a real car.

The propagation environment is assumed to be extremely non-isotropic. The proposed channel model takes into account double-bounce scattering from fixed scatterers. Due to the movement of the transmitter and the receiver, the angles of departure (AoD) and the angles of arrival (AoA) are time-variant, which makes our model non-stationary. In order to study the statistical properties of the proposed channel model, we make use of the Choi-Williams distribution. Analytical solutions are provided for the generalized local autocorrelation function (ACF), the time-frequency distribution, and the local space cross-correlation function (CCF). The proposed channel model is very useful for the design and analysis of future MIMO V2V communication systems.","","978-1-4244-4856-2","978-1-4244-5668-0","10.1109/WCSP.2009.5371438","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371438","","Autocorrelation;Automotive engineering;Fading;MIMO;Road accidents;Scattering;Solid modeling;Stochastic processes;Time frequency analysis;Transmitters","MIMO communication;direction-of-arrival estimation;mobile communication;wireless channels","Choi-Williams distribution;arrival angles;autocorrelation function;cross-correlation function;departure angles;double-bounce scattering;geometrical T-junction model;non-stationary MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle channel model;propagation environment;time-frequency distribution","","","","4","","11","","","20091231","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the constraints and outer forces which act on the drivetrain are mainly described in the form of energy or generalized forces, the preprocessing work of the modeling process is greatly simplified.

First, a mathematical model is derived for the fuel rail injection system based on hydrodynamics and the bulk modulus of elasticity and simplified reasonably for the controller design. The system is uncontrollable at the point where the pump pressure is equal transiently to the rail pressure. A simple controller is designed for driving the system to the regular case where the pump pressure is larger than the rail pressure. In order to deal with system nonlinear, a nonlinear controller is derived and rearranged in the structure of feedforward feedback. The feedforward is related to the reference dynamics and the gain is state-dependent, while the feedback includes a state-dependent PD/PID error feedback and a state feedback related to the characteristics of the fuel rail system. The structure of the controller benefits potentially to the engineering-oriented implementation. Second, robustness is analyzed in the framework of input-to-state stability, where the error induced from the controller implementation, disturbances, and uncertainties are lumped as an additive input. Finally, the designed control scheme is tested in the more realistic simulation model established in the AMESim environment and the results are satisfying.","1083-4435","","","10.1109/TMECH.2013.2285716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6655988","Feedforward;gasoline direct injection (GDI);modeling;rail pressure control;state-dependent PID","Containers;Engines;Fuels;Mathematical model;Pressure control;Rails;Valves","","","","","","0","","","","2013-11-05","","","IEEE","ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, to the best of our knowledge, no manipulation scheme has been designed to connect these specific components. The manipulation scheme was created to translate each gesture coming from the glove, into a valid command to the robotic arm. This scheme is believed to be functional because only natural gestures are required from the operator. A master-slave model is used to communicate both the local and the remote stations.

A lower dimensional MPC algorithm is developed by integrating an existing ‘move blocking’ (MB) strategy with a ‘constraint set compression’ (CSC) strategy, which is first proposed here. Good trade-off between control optimality and computational intensity is achieved by proper design of blocking and compression matrices. Application of the fast algorithm on vehicular following control (e.g. an adaptive cruise control system) was evaluated through real-time simulation. These results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the computational speed while maintaining satisfactory control optimality without sacrificing the desired performance.","","","","10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728405","","","","","","","","","","","","","20140130","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typical 36 cases with various solder shapes were examined. Thermal fatigue life including not only the crack initiation but also crack propagation was evaluated by using the finite element method. Based upon the case study's results, it was found that when a crack propagates along the side of the component, the fatigue life of the components will not be affected by the dispersion of the solder joints. However, when the crack propagates into a fillet of solder, the fatigue life will drop greatly, and it will be affected remarkably by the dispersions of the shape of solder joints. Then, based upon the analytical results, it was found that there is a strong interactive relation between the solder joints on two sides of the component, the structural asymmetry was included in the sensitivity analysis processes. It was shown that compared with a standard model (which has a symmetrical structure where fatigue cracks propagate along the side of the component) the worst case has a big unbalance between the values of the two side solder joints. The fatigue cracks change their route from the side of the component to fillet of solder in the smaller side, and the fatigue life of the component shows an 80% decrease. It means that the shape of solder joints should be designed to control the failure mode.","1930-8841","978-1-4244-2194-7","978-1-4244-2195-4","10.1109/IRWS.2008.4796103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796103","","Capacitive sensors;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Fatigue;Lead;Scattering;Shape;Soldering;Thermal engineering;Thermal expansion;Vehicles","automotive electronics;couplings;fatigue cracks;finite element analysis;fracture mechanics;integrated circuit reliability;solders;thermal stress cracking","chip components;crack propagation;fatigue cracks;finite element method;sensitivity analysis;solder joints;structural asymmetry;symmetrical structure;thermal fatigue life;vehicle electronics","","","","0","","13","","","20090227","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In coverage-directed validation, coverage metrics are defined that quantitatively measure the degree of verification coverage of the design. Motivated by recent work on observability-based coverage metrics for models described in a hardware description language, we develop a method that computes an observability-based code coverage metric for embedded software written in a high-level programming language. Given a set of input vectors, our metric indicates the instructions that had no effect on the output. An assignment that was not relevant to generate the output value cannot be considered as being covered.

As an example, the introduction of ISO 26262 in the automotive domain requires the adaptation of existing industrial development processes to comply with the upcoming standard. The proposed methods address the new demand in requirements management for a safer development of driver assistance systems. By means of ontologies, domain requirements such as from ISO 26262 are formalized providing a reference model to support semi-automated requirements discovery. Based on this formalized knowledge and an automatically identified selection criterion such as the system's Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL), the large set of process and product related requirements of ISO 26262 is tailored to a reduced set of applicable steps and methods for a project specific development process. The proposed methods have been implemented in a prototype toolchain.

In this paper, following the idea of synchronverters, the controller for a STATCOM is designed according to the mathematical model of synchronous generators that are operated in the compensator mode. As a result, no phase-locked loop (PLL) is needed. Moreover, a third operation mode, i.e. the droop control mode (or the D-mode in short), is introduced to the operation of STATCOM, in addition to the conventional voltage regulation mode (or the V -mode in short) and the direct Q control mode (or the Q-mode in short). This allows parallel-operated STATCOMs to share reactive power properly.

In this context, one of the main, critical technical challenges is the estimation of the SoC under vehicle operations, which typically do not involve full charging or discharging. This task is particularly arduous to accomplish in real-time, due to the complex and nonlinear behavior of the battery, as well as the inevitable presence of on-board measurement errors. In this work, we describe a model-based calibration process for capturing the important characteristics of modern batteries used in typical HEV applications. This process consists of reproducible procedural steps, including pre-specified data collection, while ultimately admitting a calibration. The resulting models are useful in HEV system control design for algorithms centered on maintaining the battery SoC, in algorithms for prognostics and diagnostics, and in prediction and estimation tasks.","0743-1619","978-1-4244-2078-0","978-1-4244-2079-7","10.1109/ACC.2008.4586510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4586510","","Aging;Automotive engineering;Batteries;Calibration;Control design;Hybrid electric vehicles;Measurement errors;Predictive models;Production;State estimation","battery powered vehicles;calibration;control system synthesis;hybrid electric vehicles","battery characterization;battery state-of-charge estimation;hybrid electric vehicle system control design;model-based calibration;onboard measurement error;reproducible procedural step","","","","4","","19","","","20080805","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flatness provides a convenient framework for meeting a number of performance specifications on the valve's end motion. The proposed control design incorporates voltage constraints, nonlinear magnetic effects, and various motion planning requirements. A flat output acts as a design parameter and is parameterized with a spline basis. A nonlinear feasibility problem is solved to obtain optimal spline coefficients such that performance requirements are met. The resulting flat output provides an open-loop control which is augmented with feedback so that a linear stable tracking error system results.

"Reliability Analysis of DSRC Wireless Communication for Vehicle Safety Applications","Fan Bai; Krishnan, H.","","Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference, 2006. ITSC '06. IEEE","17-20 Sept. 2006","2006","","","355","362","The 802.11-p based dedicated short range communication (DSRC) is being seriously considered as a promising wireless technology for enhancing transportation safety and highway efficiency. However, to-date, there is very little research done in characterizing the reliability of DSRC communication based on real-world experimental data, and its effect on the reliability of vehicle safety applications. Our experimental set-up includes a fleet of three vehicles equipped with DSRC communication system, GPS receiver and a number of vehicle safety applications based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication. This paper analyzes the link-level behavior of DSRC vehicle-to-vehicle communication in a wide variety of traffic environments based on real-world experimental data. In addition, we also characterize the application level reliability of DSRC for vehicle safety communication (VSC) system. Based on our experiments, we show that the reliability of DSRC vehicle-to-vehicle communication is adequate since packet drops do not occur in bursts most of the time. We also show that the application level reliability of VSC applications based on DSRC communication is quite satisfactory. Finally, we develop an analytical model to relate application level reliability with communication reliability and VSC system parameter, laying out a clear way to improve reliability of VSC applications under harsh traffic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to characterize the application-level reliability of DSRC communication for VSC applications based on real-world experimental data. Our findings develop a deep insight into significant characteristics of DSRC communication for highly mobile vehicle-to-vehicle wireless network, which will contribute to better design and evaluation of communication protocols for VSC applications in the future","","1-4244-0093-7","1-4244-0094-5","10.1109/ITSC.2006.1706767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1706767","","Analytical models;Automotive electronics;Communication system traffic;Global Positioning System;Mobile communication;Road safety;Road transportation;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicle safety;Wireless communication","Global Positioning System;automotive electronics;mobile communication;protocols;radio networks;reliability;road safety;traffic;transportation;vehicles","802.11-p;GPS receiver;application-level reliability;communication protocols;dedicated short range communication wireless communication;mobile vehicle-to-vehicle wireless network;transportation safety;vehicle safety communication;vehicle-to-vehicle communication","","","","27","","20","","","20061009","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an efficient numerical approach to thermal transient analysis of an electronic packaging,system under electrical cyclic loading conditions. A numerical solution of temperature as function of time is formulated upon which a simple computer code is written to obtain transient behavior of a system or components. Based on the lumped capacitance (LC) model, a general average power concept is presented to obtain a steady state solution from finite element modeling (FEM). The steady state solution is then used to evaluate the time constant for analysis of transient heat transfer. The transient solutions from the proposed model and those obtained from FEA show good agreement at component level. Time to transient solution of a wire resistor only takes a couple of seconds via the proposed approach while it took four hours on HP735 for the first 120 cycles. The proposed approach is demonstrated through an example of an automotive control module PCB with resistors having cyclic current input.

In this work, a holistic design through optimization framework is presented. It is based on estimating airfoil geometries' primary dimensions with corresponding constraints of buoyancy, physical constraints of components, their assembling as per the design rules, are imposed on the objective. NACA 4-digit series has been chosen as reference in our study which allows for symmetrical airfoil and associated relative ease in fabrication. The quasi-steady flow and fundamental airfoil theories are used to observe the hydrodynamic forces acting on the undulating links. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated using two heuristic and two hybrid approaches.

In a hybrid propulsion based system, the vehicle could be moving at electric only mode and when required, the internal combustion (IC) engine has to be turned on and operated, possibly at higher speeds, in a prescribed time, and in a smooth manner in order to maintain driveability. In addition, in a hybrid vehicle, several actuators are to be utilized for the purpose of IC engine speed control - these actuators should be driven by appropriate control efforts. Thus, both hybrid topology and control algorithm play key role in the challenging IC speed control task.

The goal is to design an embedded multi sensors collision avoidance system for automotive application. The system includes sensors like video camera, ultrasonic sensors, a PC hardware computer, a CAN<sup>2</sup> network and a dedicated software for signal and image processing, data fusion and AI expert system. The design of such a system is difficult under real time constraints. Therefore, a simulator is a good solution to test different parts of the system and then to help to choose the overall architecture. However simulating all the embedded architecture in real-time becomes a very complex work. It is necessary to have an environment simulator where sensors can be virtually implemented. The data are then processed leading to results without hardware costs. The designed environment software allows the simulation of physical sensors, and also the emulation of these sensors. The simulator is interfaced to the physical embedded hardware by a network bridge. So, we can emulate some sensors to experiment data processing on the physical embedded PICAR computer. This paper presents the physical smart car PICAR and its embedded system, the virtual world simulator. We explain how we can mix the virtual world (produced by virtual sensors) and real world (physical embedded system) to implement some scenarios (like automatic parking) and to validate the physical architecture.

After-Market Services (AMS) are critical for automobile part suppliers since they are required to satisfy their clients while providing on-time deliveries that are traceable on route. Offering these parts and services requires re-engineering the enterprise and integrating the processes with information systems located across the channel and around the world. This research depicts the current AMS logistics and management processes for an automobile lamp and components manufacturer. The case studies the current logistic process (e.g., shipment tracking, inventory management and order processing) and depicts the underlying business processes using Petri net diagrams. After using simulation to study bottlenecks, repetitive processes, and areas of operation that waste time and money, a to-be model is developed. The goal of the to-be model is to apply information technology to exchange and share information among supply chain participants. In order to benchmark the design of the to-be logistics model, the simulation is run and compared to the current operations. Although the research does not attempt to optimize the model, simulation runs on the to-be model are repeated until an improved solution is achieved that satisfies the manufacturerpsilas goals.

This requires cost accounting techniques that appropriately incorporate system complexity into the financial model. To this end, we propose a novel approach to extend the applicability of DES for configuration problems. The basic idea is to incorporate technical consumption or engineering production functions into Riebel's Generic Direct Cost Accounting and to add both methods to a standard DES modeling. Consequently, the informational value of DES is significantly improved. Misleading decision support can be avoided and insights into the relationship between processes and the value structure are achieved.

The evaluation is intended to demonstrate that a PBC strategy initially designed to control generation at unity power factor can control power exchange at a fixed active power delivery to the grid with different power factors. The system model assumes a wind flow of constant kinetic energy and hence a constant mechanical torque in the turbine shaft. The power network is modeled as an infinite bus connected through a line-impedance to the generator terminals.

Among the possible types of VSCF generators, a good candidate is the cascaded doubly-fed induction generator (CDFIG). This brushless robust structure is also driven by a low power converter in comparison to the power provided to the grid. However, because of its inherent complexity, an efficient control design methodology is needed. The presented paper proposes to establish a rigorous design methodology based on the inversion of the dynamical model of the system. It also uses an original representation of the system called dynamical equivalent circuit. This method has been successfully applied to two cases: a CDFIG connected to a utility grid and a CDFIG connected to an isolated grid in the presence of a significant amount of nonlinear load.","","0-7803-9252-3","","10.1109/IECON.2005.1569296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1569296","","Aerospace control;Aircraft;Automotive electronics;Converters;Electric variables control;Electric vehicles;Hydroelectric power generation;Induction generators;Power conversion;Renewable energy resources","asynchronous generators;brushless machines;control system synthesis;embedded systems;equivalent circuits;machine control;power convertors;renewable energy sources;variable speed drives","brushless robust structure;cascaded doubly-fed induction generator control;dynamical equivalent circuit;electric aircraft;electric vehicle;embedded application;low power converter;nonlinear load;renewable energy system;small-scale hydropower;utility grid;variable speed constant frequency generator;windmills","","","","3","5","10","","","20060116","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The physical resources needed to measure, record, analyze, and characterize an entire set of real, spectrally broad roads is often infeasible for simulation. This motivates the need for more accurate models for characterizing roads and for generating synthetic road profiles of a specific type. First order Markov Chain models using uniform sized bins to define the states have been previously proposed to characterize and synthetically generate road profiles. This method, however, was found to be unreliable when the number of states is increased to improve resolution. In an effort to solve this problem, this work develops a method by which states are defined using nonuniform sized, percentile-based bins which results in a more fully populated transition matrix. A statistical test is developed to quantify the confidence with which the estimated transition matrix represents the true underlying stochastic process. The order of the Markov Chain representation of the original and synthetic profiles is checked using a series of preexisting likelihood ratio criteria. This method is demonstrated on data obtained at the Virginia Tech VTTI location and shows a considerable improvement in the estimation of the transition properties of the stochastic process. This is evidenced in the subsequent generation of synthetic profiles.","0743-1619","978-1-4577-1095-7","978-1-4673-2102-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6315685","","Data models;Load modeling;Markov processes;Probability;Roads;Vehicles","Markov processes;automotive components;matrix algebra;road vehicles;statistical testing","Markov chain representation;chassis;first order Markov chain models;fully populated transition matrix;nonuniform sized percentile-based bins;physical resources;preexisting likelihood ratio criteria;road profiles simulation;statistical test;synthetic profiles;synthetic road profiles;transition properties;underlying stochastic process;uniform sized bins;vehicle designs","","","","0","","16","","","20121001","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This kind of analysis is of growing importance in the automotive, aerospace and other advanced manufacturing industries, where increasingly complex electrical, electronic and mechanical systems are being combined in safety-critical applications. FMEA is an extremely tedious process because it demands detailed and systematic examination of the operation of all aspects of the design. However, this work must be carried out by professional engineers as it requires extensive experience of the domain. These two factors, painstaking work and expert judgment, indicate the great benefits that automated help will provide for design engineers. This paper describes a program which automates the prediction of the effect of failure modes for electrical systems. This is the most challenging task in FMEA and can only be fully achieved by integrating multiple models in a distributed reasoning architecture.

In the process of automating complex automotive sub-assemblies, 3D vision-based recognition as well as grasping of complex objects is required not only for detection and categorization but also for pose estimation and robotic pick-and-place operations. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D visual perception system for sub-assembly automation based on a structured light 3D vision system. We use a novel geometric surface primitive patch segmentation approach based on Hough transforms to obtain accurate surface normal estimations from 3D point clouds for the identification of patch primitives. The most relevant primitives for our application include planar, cylindrical, conic and spherical surface patches. We extract primitive surface patches from automotive CAD models in DXF format. The models are then decomposed to simple entities such as planar polygons, vertexes and lines. Our resulting models based on the 3D point clouds are composed only by simple planes and cylinders. Our system takes advantage of the available CAD data for both object recognition and for pose estimation. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve, in only a few seconds, a highly accurate pose and object class estimation.","2161-8070","978-1-4673-0429-0","","10.1109/CoASE.2012.6386359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386359","","Automation;Design automation;Estimation;Object recognition;Robots;Solid modeling;Vectors","CAD;Hough transforms;assembling;automobile industry;bin packing;industrial robots;pose estimation;visual perception","3D point clouds;3D vision-based recognition;3D visual perception system;DXF format;Hough transforms;automotive CAD models;automotive subassembly automation;bin picking;geometric surface primitive patch segmentation approach;human-like decision making;industrial robotics;industry automation;market innovations;pose estimation;robotic pick-and-place operations","","","","0","","20","","","20121220","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To simplify control strategy and improve fuel-saving capability, we design an improved logic threshold approach of energy management for a power-split HEV assisted by an integrated starter generator (ISG). The improved logic threshold controller manages the ICE within its peak-efficiency region at first. Then the electrical power demand is established based on the ICE energy output. On that premise, a variable logic threshold value is defined to achieve the power distribution between the ISG and the electric motor/generator (EMG). Finally, simulation models for the power-split HEV with improved logic threshold controller are established in ADVISOR. The ICE, EMG and ISG operating performances of power-split HEV are performed under two driving cycles. The comprehensive results show that battery power consumption reduces up to 8%, the ICE efficiency improves up to 1.7%, the motor driving system efficiency improves up to 6.1% of a power-split HEV with the improved logic threshold approach compared with one with the logic threshold approach.","","978-1-4799-2518-6","","10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681787","ISG;logic threshold approach;power-split HEV","Biological system modeling;Energy management;Generators;Hybrid electric vehicles;Ice;Torque","automotive components;electric generators;electric motors;hybrid electric vehicles;power consumption;power distribution;power transmission (mechanical)","ADYISOR;EMG;ICE efficiency;ISG;battery power consumption reduction;electric motor-generator;electrical power demand;energy management;fuel-saving capability;integrated starter generator;logic threshold controller;motor driving system efficiency;power distribution;power-split HEV power train;power-split hybrid electric vehicle;variable logic threshold value","","","","0","","","","","20131219","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then the PID control for air suspension is implemented on the rebuilt bench test system which is self-developed. Considering the simulation and test results, the conclusion can be drawn that the PID control algorithm is feasible and effective for controlling air suspension.","","978-1-4244-9247-3","","10.1109/GCIS.2010.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708675","PID control;riding comfort component;semi-active suspension;test","Acceleration;Atmospheric modeling;Control systems;Roads;Suspensions;Vehicles;Vibrations","acceleration;control system synthesis;elasticity;ergonomics;mathematics computing;road vehicles;springs (mechanical);suspensions (mechanical components);three-term control;vibration control","Matlab;PID control system design;Simulink;bench test system;electronically controlled air suspension;quarter-vehicle model;spring stiffness;sprung mass;vehicle air spring suspension system;vehicle handling stability;vehicle riding comfort;vertical vibration acceleration","","","","0","","6","","","20110204","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A detailed model of the motor including current dependent inductance coefficients is used. The load exerted on the motor by the caliper may be modeled as a spring; however, the actual load model is taken to be an unknown nonlinear function of position to allow for uncertainties in the model. Hence, the developed controller works for a wide variety of loads including brake systems. The controller is designed using backstepping and incorporates a novel voltage commutation scheme. The controller does not require knowledge of the mechanical parameters of the motor and the functional forms of the relationships among the motor position, the brake force, and the motor load torque. Moreover, the controller provides significant robustness to uncertainty in the inductances. Furthermore, practical current and voltage constraints are addressed. The performance and robustness of the controller are demonstrated through simulation studies.","","0-7803-9567-0","","10.1109/CDC.2005.1582455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1582455","","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Force control;Industrial control;Nonlinear control systems;Reluctance machines;Reluctance motors;Robust control;Uncertainty","","","","","","1","","24","","","20060130","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unwind (rewind) roll in a web processing line releases (accumulates) unfinished (finished) web to (from) the process section. Second, a strategy for computing the equilibrium control inputs and reference velocities for each driven roll/roller is given; this strategy is based on dividing the web processing line into tension zones and using the reference web tension of each zone and the reference velocity of the master speed roller which sets the desired web transport speed. Based on the new model developed, a decentralized controller is proposed. Variations in web tension and transport velocity in each tension zone are shown to asymptotically converge to zero.

It is difficult to have error evaluation because the CAD model and the point cloud data are impossible to make automatic alignment. Therefore, on the basis of the surface reconstruction of reverse engineering software Imageware and the comparative functions between surface and point cloud data, we propose a new perspective of detecting digital error, i.e. the contour adjustment of surface automatically by the way of golden section method. Under the condition of satisfying the least square method, this method, which can make anastomosis for the actual and theoretical surface, reduces and even eliminates the position error caused by the inconsistency between the actual reference and CAD model reference, laying a foundation to measure shape error by the way of direct alignment method and reducing time as well as improving the error detection precision.

Mobility models used in traditional mobile ad hoc networks cannot directly be applied to VANETs since real-world factors such as road layouts and traffic regulations are not considered. In this paper, we propose a vehicular mobility model that reflects real-world vehicle movement and study the performance of packet-routing protocols. First, we study the routing in small-scale VANETs and propose two routing schemes: (1) connection-based restricted forwarding (CBRF) and (2) connectionless geographic forwarding (CLGF). With the insights obtained, we consider routing in large-scale VANETs. Since road complexity and traffic variety may cause many potential problems that existing routing protocols cannot address, we introduce a two-phase routing protocol (TOPO) that incorporates road map information. The proposed protocol defines an <i>overlay</i> graph with roads of high vehicular density and <i>access</i> graphs that are connected to the <i>overlay</i>. While in the <i>overlay</i>, packets are forwarded along a precalculated path. As far as <i>access</i> routing is concerned, we employ the aforementioned CBRF and CLGF schemes and send packets to the <i>overlay</i> or handle packets delivered from the <i>overlay</i>. We argue that the TOPO can serve as a framework that integrates existing VANET routing protocols. We also consider data diversity in VANETs and design the TOPO as an <i>intelligent transportation system (ITS)-friendly</i> protocol. To validate our design philosophy and the routing protocol, we use different areas in the city of Orlando, FL, and generate vehicular mobility traces, following our mobility models. We feed the traces to network simulators and study the routing behavior. Simulation results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed routing protocols for large-scal- - e VANET scenarios.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2025652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089413","Mobility;networks;routing;vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)","","ad hoc networks;automotive electronics;mobile radio;routing protocols","connection-based restricted forwarding;connectionless geographic forwarding;large-scale routing;mobile wireless ad hoc network;small-scale routing;traffic monitoring;two-phase routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;vehicular safety","","","","15","","45","","2009-06-19","20091110","","IEEE","IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of their system-oriented environmental performance representation, life-cycle assessment metrics are needed to be included in such a set. This study investigates the dynamic life cycle analysis with regard to energy consumption and resources utilization due to layout design changes. Using the proposed LCS (Life Cycle Simulation) methodology, simulation of current state-of-the-art manufacturing process is performed.

Moreover, the efficiency of the system is greatly promoted when the feedforward lookup table becomes adaptive. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capability of these control units.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677460","Adaptive;Air Supply System;Blower;Fuel cell;Lookup Table","Adaptive control;Cathodes;Control systems;Employee welfare;Engines;Fuel cell vehicles;Fuel cells;Power system modeling;Table lookup;Temperature control","air;feedback;feedforward;fuel cell power plants;table lookup","air starvation;ambient air condition;blower aging;current translator;environment alteration;feedback controller;feedforward lookup table;fuel cell air supply system;fuel cell stack","","","","0","","6","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two different models have been used, both validated on data coming from an instrumented car, a differential equation based physical model and a neural network purely numerical method. Up to 23 objective functions have been defined, at least 14 of which showing to be in strict clash each other. The equivalent scalar function based formulation is intentionally avoided due to its well known limitations. A fuzzy definition of optima, being a generalization of Pareto-optimality, is applied to the problem. The result of such an approach is that subsets of Pareto-optimal solutions (being on such a problem a big portion of the entire search space) can be properly selected as a consequence of inputs from the designer. The obtained optimal solutions are compared with the reference vehicle and with the optima previously obtained with design of experiments techniques and different MO optimization strategies.","","0-7803-8515-2","","10.1109/CEC.2004.1330831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1330831","","Decision making;Design optimization;Differential equations;History;Instruments;Neural networks;Numerical models;Pareto optimization;Research and development;Vehicles","Pareto optimisation;automotive engineering;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy set theory;mechanical engineering computing;numerical analysis;product design","MO optimization strategies;Pareto-optimality;differential equation;fuzzy-optima definition;instrumented car;multiobjective optimization;neural network;numerical method;physical model;racing car tyre-suspension system;scalar function","","","","0","","30","","","20040903","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These services need antennas which often must be placed very close to each other. This is the case with roof antennas that operate in different frequency ranges for GSM, UMTS, GPS and SDARS applications. The development of such antenna systems poses a new challenge due to the fact that more antennas shall occupy the same place reserved for the existent systems as the exterior design should stay the same. This will be the case with the additional integrated LTE, WIMAX and Car-2-X antennas. Besides that, the performance of individual services should be kept constant independently of the antenna system configuration. In other words, should a customer have the possibility to order a system without one or more services, the remaining antennas must keep the same individual performance. In order to expedite the development process and reduce the costs related to the usage of prototype cars, numerical computations based on the surface discretising method of moments (MoM) are successfully used for development of different glass antenna systems. For the roof antenna systems volume discretising simulation approaches appear, however, to be a better choice. With the implementation of the method of Finite-Volume Time domain FVTD, in the used simulation framework, a complete system evaluation based on simulations using volume discretisation is now possible to be carried out accurately. In this work, a comparison between simulations realized with the old MoM used solver and simulations based on the FVTD method will be presented. In addition, the simulation results are validated by measurements. Furthermore, potential coupling between different antennas are investigated. Finally, suggestions for optimal individual antenna placement inside the roof antenna system are given.","","978-1-4577-0250-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5782223","","Antennas;Assembly;Global Positioning System;Mathematical model;Moment methods;Solid modeling;Wireless LAN","3G mobile communication;Global Positioning System;Long Term Evolution;WiMax;broadband antennas;cellular radio;finite volume methods;method of moments;mobile antennas;time-domain analysis","Car-2-X antennas;GPS;GSM;LTE;MoM;SDARS;UMTS;WiMax;finite volume time domain method;glass antenna systems;method of moments;numerical computations;roof antenna system;wideband automotive antenna systems","","","","0","","8","","","20110531","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

One automation approach is search-based testing for which the task of generating test data is transformed into an optimization problem which is solved using metaheuristic search techniques. However, only little work has been done so far applying search-based testing techniques to continuous functional models, such as SIMULINK STATEFLOW models. This paper presents the current state of my thesis developing a new approach for automatically generating continuous test data sets achieving high structural model coverage for SIMULINK models containing STATEFLOW diagrams using search-based testing. The expected contribution of this work is to demonstrate how search-based testing techniques can be applied successfully to continuous functional models and how to cope with the arising problems such as generating and optimizing continuous signals, covering structural model elements and dealing with the complexity of the models.","","978-1-4244-3495-4","","10.1109/ICSE-COMPANION.2009.5071030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071030","","Automatic testing;Automation;Automotive engineering;Communication industry;Embedded software;Embedded system;Signal generators;Signal processing;Software testing;System testing","optimisation;program testing;systems analysis","Simulink models;Stateflow diagrams;model-based software design;optimization problem;search-based testing;systematic model testing;test case generation","","","","2","","8","","","20090612","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The balance of feed system in the multi-cavity mould depends on the layout of the cavities and runners. Taking a set of four-cavity injection mould for an example in this paper, the cavity layout is optimizedly designed and the optimized scheme of feed system is determined based on CAE simulation analysis on the two schemes of feed system using Moldflow software.

To avoid at least a part of these problems a general architecture can be planned within an organization to facilitate reuse. This offers benefits such as cost savings, lower redundancy, improved productivity and quality. Complexity increases significantly with use or reuse of external blocks, as they may not adhere to the internal architecture. Major challenges are in identifying the commonality of functionality, where the designs involve variability (ability to customize) within these blocks. The concept of a Software Product Line (SPL) largely addresses this issue. But in addition to variants, their versions/releases also play an important role for effective management over the entire product cycle from concept, design, development, test up to after sales maintenance. Moreover, to reduce the development time, processes to assist team members when choosing a component from the core assets is essential. Our proposal is based on the work with the industrial design tool named ESCAPE. It addresses the issues to identify commonality based on architecture, functionality and naming conventions in identification, specification and realization of variants within a product development as well as to assist the development team. As this tool in the discussed aspect follows the practices commonly used in industry, it can be seen as an example without limiting the general validity of the proposed process for variability management.","","978-1-4244-8068-5","978-0-7695-4181-5","10.1109/ICCGI.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628916","Embedded Systems;Software Configuration;Variability Management","Automotive engineering;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Hardware;Software;Unified modeling language","configuration management;product life cycle management;software architecture;software development management;software reusability","ESCAPE tool;complex embedded network;development team;development time;embedded system;functional block;general architecture;industrial design tool;large scale development;model-based variability management;organization;product cycle;product development;software configuration;software product line;software reuse;team member","","","","0","","14","","","20101111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Designers are faced with the continuous challenge of reducing manufacturing costs and design cycle times while improving the systems performance and reliability. In practical design, sequential linear programming (SLP) is very popular because of its inherent simplicity and easy availability. However, the inherent conceptual simplicity makes the SLP techniques not globally convergent. This research presents a new algorithm that uses a linearization error and an interior point trust-region method in SLP to truss structures that is both considered sizing and configuration problems. The algorithm may be suitable for large optimization problems where time is a constraint and the optimization may be stopped before convergence is achieved. Results of application studies are presented, illustrating the applicability of the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-9712-6","978-0-7695-4335-2","10.1109/CSO.2011.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5957607","interior point methods;linearization error;sequential linear programming;structural optimization;trust region methods","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Convergence;Linear programming;Optimization","design engineering;linear programming;structural engineering;supports","linearization error;optimization problems;sequential linear programming;simulation-based design;truss structures;trust region interior point algorithm","","","","0","","11","","","20110718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A model taken from the literature is used to simulate the dynamic of a kite whose lines are suitably pulled by a control unit. Energy is generated by a cycle composed of two phases, indicated as the traction and the drag one. The kite control unit is placed on the arm of a vertical axis rotor, which is connected to an electric drive able to act as generator when the kite lines pull the rotor and as motor in dragging the kite against the wind flow. In each phase, control is obtained by ""fast"" implementations of suitable NMPC designs. In the traction phase the control is designed such that the kite pulls the rotor arm, maximizing the amount of generated energy. When the kite is not able to generate energy any more, the control enters the drag phase and the kite is driven to a region where the energy spent to drag the rotor is a small fraction of the energy generated in the traction phase, until a new traction phase is undertaken. Simulation results are presented, showing that KiteGen may represent a quantum leap in wind energy generation.","0743-1619","1-4244-0988-8","1-4244-0989-6","10.1109/ACC.2007.4282697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4282697","","Automatic control;Automotive components;Costs;Milling machines;Paper technology;Production;Rotors;Wind energy;Wind energy generation;Wind forecasting","control system synthesis;power generation control;wind power","KiteGen project;electric drive;kite control unit;tethered airfoils;vertical axis rotor;wind energy generation;wind energy generators;wind flow;wind mills","","","","2","","12","","","20070730","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem, a neural network is used to model the plant and the parameter tuning of the system is performed by the humoral immune algorithm. After the PID parameters are determined through this off-line manner, these gains are then applied to the plant for the online control using immune adaptive algorithm. Moreover, even though the neural network model may not be accurate enough initially, the weighting parameters are adjusted to be accurate through the online fine tuning.

Such misperceptions have already been reported in literature where several evaluation methods have been proposed for researching possible causes. Unfortunately, most of the methods do not represent the scenarios usually found in the automotive industry, since they focus on too large distances of five to fifteen meters.

These configurations are commonly based on abstract management policies. Embedded devices usually lack the resources to perform the necessary computations to derive an actual configuration from an abstract policy. Thus we developed a two phase management approach that splits up the management process into a design-time and a runtime task. At design-time a model of the managed system is created. This model is augmented by high-level, environment-aware management policies that are automatically refined to low-level service configurations using graph-transformation techniques. This phase is based on the concepts of model-based management and on parts of the generalized role based access control model to handle the modeling of the environment-aware policies. The runtime phase covers the enforcement of the environment-aware management policies by a set of management services responsible for the setting of suitable service configurations.","","0-7803-9094-6","","10.1109/INDIN.2005.1560365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560365","","Automotive engineering;Communication industry;Computer network management;Embedded computing;Environmental management;Object oriented modeling;Power system management;Runtime environment;Telecommunication computing;Telecommunication network management","configuration management;distributed processing;embedded systems","abstract management policies;access control model;automated runtime management;design-time modeling;embedded devices;embedded service systems;environment-aware management policies;environment-aware policies;graph-transformation techniques;model transformation;model-based management;phase management approach","","","","3","","12","","","20051219","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These advances facilitate the integration of model-based diagnosis and prognosis of systems, leading to condition-based maintenance and increased availability of systems. With an accurate simulation model of a system, diagnostics and prognostics can be synthesized concurrently with system design. In this paper, we develop an integrated prognostic process based on data collected from model-based simulations under nominal and degraded conditions. Prognostic models are constructed based on different random load conditions (modes). An interacting multiple model (IMM) is used to track the hidden damage.

As a result, there has been a lot of recent interest in timing and predictability analysis techniques that are specifically targeted towards FlexRay. In this paper we propose a compositional performance analysis framework for a network of electronic control units (ECUs) that communicate via a FlexRay bus. Given a specification of the tasks running on the different ECUs, the scheduling policy used at each ECU, and a specification of the FlexRay bus (e.g. slot sizes and message priorities), our framework can answer questions related to the maximum end-to-end delay experienced by any message, the amount of buffer required at each communication controller and the utilization of the different ECUs and the bus. In contrast to previous timing analysis techniques which analyze the FlexRay bus in isolation, our framework is fully compositional and allows the modeling of the schedulers at the ECUs and the FlexRay protocol in a seamless manner. As a result, it can be used to analyze large systems and does not involve any computationally expensive step like solving an ILP (which previous approaches require). We illustrate our framework using detailed examples and also present results from a Matlab-based implementation.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261192","Automotive electronics;Bus protocols;Design;FlexRay;Performance","Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer languages;Delay;Mathematical model;Performance analysis;Processor scheduling;Protocols;Size control;Timing","automotive electronics;protocols","communication controller;compositional performance analysis framework;end-to-end delay;flexray-based electronic control units;invehicle automotive communication systems;performance analysis;predictability analysis techniques;predominant protocol","","","","9","","","","","20070625","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stability analysis and supervisory control design requires a good model of the system that considers different operations within the microgrid, such as voltage/current levels, bidirectional power flows, and on/off switching of the power converters. In this paper, a state variable modeling approach is presented to develop a hybrid large-scale system model of the microgrid. State variable models of individual converters linearized at different operating points are the building blocks of the model. A large-scale interconnected system model is developed for each feasible interconnection of the linearized models of the converters. The switching model, which is a combination of state based and input based switching events between these large- scale system models, is developed using hybrid system theory.

New intelligent functionalities of vehicles have been implemented in a number of electronic control units (ECUs) that are connected to each in vehicle control networks (VCNs). However, with the rapid increase in the number of ECUs, VCNs currently face several challenges, e.g., design complexity, space constraints, system reliability, and interdependency. Considering these factors, the complexity of the VCN design problem exponentially increases, which means that the problem cannot be solved within a reasonable time using conventional optimization techniques. In this paper, we report a new methodology for the optimal design of VCNs. An analytical model was derived to examine the fundamental characteristics of the VCN design problem. Compared with the case of a conventional data network, which typically considers temporal scheduling over a fixed physical topology, the VCN design problem should also consider spatial constraints, e.g., volume, position, and weight. Moreover, the spatial constraints change during the solving procedure. Such temporal and spatial joint optimization problems with varying constraints incur extremely high computational complexity. To tackle the high complexity, this paper proposes a fast solution based on a repeated-matching method, which reduces the problem complexity from <i>O</i>(<i>NNN</i>) to <i>O</i>(<i>NN</i><sup>3</sup>). By applying our methodology to a number of different real-world VCN design scenarios, this proposal can produce a 1% near-optimal design within a significantly reduced time.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2011.2161680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5957342","Design optimization;in-vehicle communication;repeated-matching method;simulated annealing (SA);topological optimization;vehicle control networks (VCNs)","Complexity theory;Optimization;Reliability;Resource management;Timing;Vehicles;Wiring","automotive electronics;controller area networks;optimisation;scheduling;vehicles","VCN design;computational complexity;design optimization;electronic control units;electronic technology;intelligent functionalities;problem complexity;repeated-matching method;temporal scheduling;vehicle control networks;vehicle convenience;vehicle safety","","","","4","","47","","2011-07-18","20110912","","IEEE","IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings","6-10 March 2006","2006","1","","1","1","The increasing importance of electronics in the automotive industry is illustrated by the growing proportion of manufacturing costs taken up by electrical and electronic systems - this has now reached approx. 30%. At the same time, electrical and electronic systems are the main cause of vehicle failures in the field, accounting for approx. 30% of these. Manufacturers and also suppliers are well aware of the problems caused by the increasing number of electronic control units (ECUs). Thus, quality assurance is becoming increasingly important, as problems in quality are a liability risk, with the danger of image problems and the cost of recall campaigns and rectification. The realization is that ""good quality is expensive, bad quality even more so"". Quality must not be left behind by the immense speed at which new technologies and functions are being developed. Quality is becoming a decisive factor in competition, and quality assurance is becoming a key task and a core competence; and testing is a key component of quality assurance. To allow testing throughout the entire development process, powerful and efficient means of developing and describing tests are necessary. These also have to take into account the various requirements of the test tasks and the different development phases.

"Quo Vadis, SLD? Reasoning About the Trends and Challenges of System Level Design","Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A.","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA","Proceedings of the IEEE","March 2007","2007","95","3","467","506","System-level design (SLD) is considered by many as the next frontier in electronic design automation (EDA). SLD means many things to different people since there is no wide agreement on a definition of the term. Academia, designers, and EDA experts have taken different avenues to attack the problem, for the most part springing from the basis of traditional EDA and trying to raise the level of abstraction at which integrated circuit designs are captured, analyzed, and synthesized from. However, my opinion is that this is just the tip of the iceberg of a much bigger problem that is common to all system industry. In particular, I believe that notwithstanding the obvious differences in the vertical industrial segments (for example, consumer, automotive, computing, and communication), there is a common underlying basis that can be explored. This basis may yield a novel EDA industry and even a novel engineering field that could bring substantial productivity gains not only to the semiconductor industry but to all system industries including industrial and automotive, communication and computing, avionics and building automation, space and agriculture, and health and security, in short, a real technical renaissance. In this paper, I present the challenges faced by industry in system level design. Then, I propose a design methodology, platform-based design (PBD), that has the potential of addressing these challenges in a unified way. Further, I place methodology and tools available today in the PBD framework and present a tool environment, Metropolis, that supports PBD and that can be used to integrate available tools and methods together with two examples of its application to separate industrial domains","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.890107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4167779","Embedded software;embedded systems;models and tools;platform-based design (PBD);system-level design (SLD);system-level design environments","Aerospace electronics;Aerospace industry;Automotive engineering;Communication industry;Computer industry;Design methodology;Electronic design automation and methodology;Integrated circuit synthesis;Superluminescent diodes;System-level design","electronic design automation;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;integrated software;programming environments","EDA industry;Metropolis tool environment;design methodology;electronic design automation;embedded software;integrated circuit designs;platform-based design;productivity gains;system level design environments","","","","61","","217","","","20070430","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We show that this problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem, and that this optimal control problem can berobust solved numerically. Even with the optimal transient trajectories, our results highlight a difficulty in identifying parameters in a transient fuel model if parameters in the model of exhaust gas mixing and in the model of the universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor are uncertain. The second topic addresses this difficulty through the use of adaptation to adjust parameters in a transient fuel compensation algorithm, until the deviation of measured fuel-to-air ratio from the commanded fuel-to-air ratio is sufficiently reduced. Our adaptation approach is shown to be robust to uncertainties in UEGO sensor and exhaust mixing dynamics.

Aiming at MPC based vehicular ACC algorithm, this paper studies its robustness and computing feasibility issues for the purpose of applying the algorithm into vehicle products. In order to enhance its robustness to model mismatch, feedback correction method is adopted to compensate the predictive error of vehicular following model and improve its predictive precision on the system state. Constraint management method is employed to revise the cost function and soften the I/O constraints of predictive optimization problem, avoiding the computing infeasibility of control law caused by larger tracking errors.

To overcome the shortcomings of the existing models based on the modified Reynolds equation (MRE), the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a natural choice in modeling high Knudsen number (Kn) flows owing to its advantages over conventional methods. The transient and parallel nature makes this LBM an attractive tool for the next generation air bearing design. Although LBM has been successfully applied to single component systems, a multicomponent system analysis has been thwarted because of the complexity in coupling the terms for each component. Previous studies have shown good results in modeling immiscible component mixtures by use of an interparticle potential. In this paper, we extend our LBM model to predict the flow rate of high Kn pressure-driven flows in multicomponent gas mixture air bearings, such as the air–helium system. For accurate modeling of slip conditions near the wall, we adopt our LBM scheme with spatially dependent relaxation times for air bearings in HDIs. To verify the accuracy of our code, we tested our scheme via simple two-dimensional benchmark flows. In the pressure-driven flow of an air–helium mixture, we found that the simple linear combination of pure helium and pure air flow rates, based on helium and air mole fraction, gives considerable error when compared to our LBM calculation.

Then, a novel post machined threshold accelerometer is designed, which consists of eight oblique post beams with an inertial mass in the middle to ensure its single moving direction and an electrical contact part fabricated on the bottom of the inertial mass. The threshold accelerometer is an integration of a threshold sensor and an inertial driven actuator used in airbag restraint systems. When the acceleration reaches the threshold, the beams buckle and close the threshold accelerometer, and when it gets down to be a certain value, the accelerometer opens quickly under the effect of the elastic force developed by the postbuckling beams. Compared with the design models of other threshold accelerometers with linear beam structures, the nonlinear postbuckling beams are introduced as threshold sensing elements. A number of design factors such as the air film damping and the contact force are taken into full consideration, thus establishing the dynamic equation of the accelerometer under coupled forces. The dynamical simulation for the strong nonlinear system with elliptic integrals indicates its good threshold characteristic and high contact reliability. The threshold accelerometer responds within 4 ms when it is triggered by a threshold acceleration ac = 20 g, and cuts off quickly when the cutoff acceleration is under ad = 5 g. Meanwhile, the unstable contact time is only 0.02 ms for the contact force to reach 50 mN, which guarantees the contact resistance to be less than 20 mOmega. With the results of the dynamic simulation, supported by previous buckling experiments, the accelerometer can provide accurate threshold sensing without false actuations under interferences outside, especially electromagnetic and vibration interferences, and hence their wide applications in safe-arming systems.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2007.897936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4231847","Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS);nonlinear stiffness;postbuckling;threshold accelerometer","Acceleration;Accelerometers;Actuators;Contacts;Damping;Electromagnetic interference;Force sensors;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Particle beams;Sensor systems","accelerometers;automotive components;beams (structures);buckling;damping;elastic constants;electrical contacts;microactuators;microsensors","air film damping;airbag restraint systems;contact resistance;elastic force;electrical contact;electromagnetic interferences;inertial driven actuator;inertial mass;linear beam structures;nonlinear stiffness;postbuckling beam;postbuckling structures;postbuckling theory;safe-arming systems;threshold accelerometer;threshold sensor;vibration interferences","","","","9","","24","","","20070611","","IEEE","IEEE Sensors Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to limit the impact of PHEVs' charging on the utility AC grid, a fuzzy logic power flow controller is designed. Based on their power requirements, PHEVs were classified into five charging priorities with different rates according to the developed controller. The charging rates depend on the predicted PV output power, the power demand by the PHEVs and the price of energy from the utility grid. The developed system can dramatically limit the impacts of PHEVs on the utility grid and reduce the charging cost. The system structure and the developed PHEVs smart charging algorithm are described.

This vehicle, called ATS/AGV, is based on a four wheel drive and four wheel steer concept which allows for a high handling performance in combination with the ability to carry out very complex manoeuvres. A structured design methodology appears to be essential to a cost and time effective design and technical specification of the AGV. This design methodology is strongly based on a dynamic model of the AGV which incorporates essential dynamics and nonlinearities, the latter mainly arising from the tyre-road contact behaviour. The other important aspect is the application often rig experiments. Within this design methodology, the development of the path control system takes place in an early stage and is carried out in close cooperation with the mechanical hardware specification. This makes the AGV a truly mechatronic product. Experiments show that ATS/AGV is capable of executing complex manoeuvres with a high dynamic performance.","","0-7803-7346-4","","10.1109/IVS.2002.1187940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187940","","Control systems;Costs;Design methodology;Hardware;Intelligent vehicles;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Traffic control;Vehicle driving;Vehicle dynamics;Wheels","automatic guided vehicles;control nonlinearities;knowledge based systems;mechatronics;road vehicles","ATS/AGV;VEHIL;automatic guided vehicle;dynamics;four wheel drive;four wheel steering;hardware-in-the-loop intelligent vehicle simulator;high-performance AGV;mechanical hardware specification;nonlinearities;path control system development;test rig experiments;tyre-road contact behaviour","","","","3","","","","","20030326","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The observer is designed such that the error dynamics system is input-to-state stability (ISS), where model errors including mass and CoG variation, and estimation or measurement error of the maximum tire-road friction coefficient are considered as additive disturbance inputs. Then, the condition of the observer gain satisfied is obtained by the ISS analysis and the lower observer gain is obtained through the convex optimisation described by the linear matrix inequalities. The proposed observer requires fewer tuning parameters and thus indicates an easier implementation compared with the existing extended Kalman filter.

These characteristics are desirable in an micro underwater vehicle. Biologists have recently found that the boxfish's body shape generates self-correcting trimming forces by shedding counter rotating vortices to compensate for the instabilities in turbulent water. The purpose of this work is to study the effect of body shape on self-correcting vortex generation and use these results to design the outer body shape of a micro underwater vehicle mimicking a real boxfish. To this end, computer aided design and Engineering (CAD/CAE) tools such as solid modeling software and fluid flow simulation software were used for analysis and comparison of different body shapes. In this paper we present the numerical simulation results for two varieties of boxfish, namely the spotted boxfish the Buffalo trunkfish, and the results were used to derive key design guidelines for a suitable body shape that can exhibit the desired self-correcting mechanism.

The unwind roll in a web processing line releases unfinished web to the process section; the rewind roll accumulates the finished web. Second, a strategy for computing the equilibrium inputs and reference velocities for each driven roll/roller is given; this strategy is based on dividing the web processing line into tension zones and using the reference web tension of each zone and the reference velocity of the master speed roller, which sets the desired web transport speed for the process line. Based on the new model developed, a decentralized controller is proposed. Variations in web tension and transport velocity in each tension zone are shown to exponentially converge to zero.

The algorithm takes into account the EGO-vehicle's driving state and the high-level representation of surrounding objects. Next the presented approach is evaluated from a real-time perspective by applying static code analysis to a reference implementation of the algorithm. The results suggest the application of further optimization techniques as the computational complexity does not allow an effective real-time behavior. In order to guarantee both real-time constraints and effective collision detection a novel method for the preselection of potential collision opponents based on the Random Forest classifier is employed.

In the conventional FLC, parameters adjustment is done by the system response, expert knowledge or trial-and-error scheme. In this paper, EP algorithm is adopted to search the optimum parameters of the FLC for ASS by minimizing a fitness function that composed of all the desired performance of a full-car model. In order to make comparison, we also introduce the optimal active suspension control (OASC) scheme. Two kinds of road profiles, a bumped road and a white noise random road, are exploited to test the performance.

Although the number of applied Electronic Control Units (ECUs) decreases, they have to fulfill more and more functions concerning performance, comfort and safety. The electric and electronic architecture (EEA) of a vehicle forms the basis for those features and functionalities. An elaborated and evaluated EEA is developed in the concept phases of the vehicle development lifecycle. For a short time, the tool PREEvision offers the possibilities to model EEAs considering different views to the architecture (requirements, software, hardware, wiring harness, topology, etc.). For test and evaluation of the vehicle's functionalities, Hardware in the Loop (HiL) technology is utilized to cover the integration phase of hardware and software. The specification and design of HiL test systems (HiL-TS) is a complex and time-consuming procedure that can be supported by information about electric and electronic artifacts and their relationship, both available in the EEA model. This paper presents an approach for rapid specification, development and application of HiL-TSs as well as rapidly prototyping systems.","","978-1-4244-7073-0","978-1-4244-7072-3","10.1109/RSP.2010.5656344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5656344","","Computational modeling;Connectors;Data mining;Hardware;Object oriented modeling;Software;Vehicles","automotive electronics;electronic engineering computing;formal specification;vehicles","ECU;HiL technology;automotive domain;electric architecture;electronic architecture;electronic control unit;hardware-in-the-loop test system;rapid specification;vehicle development lifecycle","","","","0","","12","","","20101203","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These applications are characterized by broad operating range as well as rapid and unpredictable changes in operating condition. Significant nonlinearity, input, and output constraints, and stringent performance requirements have led to the proposal of many different advanced control strategies. This article introduces a model predictive feedback controller based on a nonlinear, reduced order model. Computational effort is significantly reduced through successive linearization, analytical solutions, and a varying terminal cost function. A gradient-based parameter adaptation law is employed to achieve consistent performance. The controller is demonstrated in simulation for an on-highway heavy-duty diesel engine over two widely different emissions test cycles and for 24 different plants.

The analysis of the dependability of such systems is a particularly complex task that mandates modeling capabilities in both the discrete and in the continuous domains. To tackle this problem a multi-level approach is presented here, which is based on abstract functional models to capture the behavior of the whole system, and on detailed structural models to cope with the details of system components. In this paper, we describe how the interaction between the two levels of abstraction is managed to provide accurate analysis of the dependability of the whole system. In particular, the proposed technique is shown to be able to identify faults affecting the CAN network whose effects are most likely to be critical for vehicle's dynamic. Exploiting the information about the effects of these faults, they can then be further analyzed at the higher level of details.","","1-58113-947-0","","10.1109/SBCCI.2004.241020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1360547","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Fault diagnosis;Information analysis;Permission;Protocols;Testing;Vehicle dynamics","automotive electronics;controller area networks;protocols;road safety;traffic engineering computing;vehicle dynamics","CAN protocol;automotive fields;complex tasks;dependability analysis;digital components;functional models;mechanical components;multilevel approach;networked systems;safety critical applications;vehicle dynamics","","","","0","","","","","20041130","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Leveling on vehicle attitude was implemented by controlling suspension deflections and movements of vehicle body heave, pitch and roll. After these, vehicle stability is promoted when excited by discrete load disturbances. In the process of designing attitude controller, a method named by input decoupling transformation was used to transfer the movement of vehicle body heave, pitch and roll to suspension related movement. Simulation results show that active suspension controlled by attitude controller plus ride controller, compared with passive suspension and active suspension controlled by exclusive ride controller, can not only enhance ride comfort, but also promote attitude leveling ability for road vehicle.

Firstly, two-axis model of a 7.5 hp industrial copper-rotor SEIG is developed to perform numerical investigations under static loading conditions, faulty conditions and hence derive data for designing the ANN based detection scheme. Fault tolerant capability of the machine is experimentally elicited by applying a short-circuit fault across the terminals of the machine and the need for fault detection in the SEIG system is discussed.

Process improvement is facilitated by the development and use of models that account for and illuminate important characteristics of the process. Iteration is a fundamental but often unaddressed feature of product development (PD) processes. Its impact is mediated by the architecture of a process, i.e., its constituent activities and their interactions. This paper integrates several important characteristics of PD processes into a single model, highlighting the effects of varying process architecture. The PD process is modeled as a network of activities that exchange deliverables. Each activity has an uncertain duration and cost, an improvement curve, and risks of rework based on changes in its inputs. A work policy governs the timing of activity execution and deliverable exchange (and thus the amount of activity concurrency). The model is analyzed via simulation, which outputs sample cost and schedule outcome distributions. Varying the process architecture input varies the output distributions. Each distribution is used with a target and an impact function to determine a risk factor. Alternative process architectures are compared, revealing opportunities to trade cost and schedule risk. Example results and applications are shown for an industrial process, the preliminary design of an uninhabited combat aerial vehicle. The model yields and reinforces several managerial insights, including: how rework cascades through a PD process, trading off cost and schedule risk, interface criticality, and occasions for iterative overlapping.","0018-9391","","","10.1109/TEM.2002.806709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176870","","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Costs;Design engineering;Job shop scheduling;Process design;Product development;Risk management;Timing;Vehicles","costing;economics;product development;research and development management;risk management","competitive leverage;development costs;development processes improvement;improvement curve;interface criticality;process architecture input;product development;risks;schedule risk;uninhabited combat aerial vehicle","","","","84","","85","","","20030219","","IEEE","IEEE Technology Management Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Normal operation is governed by the auto-cycle function of a logic controller. A modular logic controller is introduced and formalized for high volume transfer lines. Its event-based functional properties are verified and its reconfigurability is considered. A live and safe marked graph can be directly transformed into a sequential function chart (which is one of the IEC 1131-3 languages) and, using this SFC representation, a modular logic controller can be implemented. The performance analysis of the modular logic controller is also introduced. The cycle time during normal operation is used as the performance metric of a transfer line.

By using two wheel-side clutches and two motors in the left and the right rear wheel, the rear electric axle is designed. The transmission is replaced with a pair of gear in the front mechanical axle. Because there is none of differential in the rear electric axle, a novel electronic differential is designed by using logic threshold theory. An exposition has been made upon the structure and the control tactics of this driving system. And another exposition has been made upon the principle of the electronic differential. The method of designing is also expounded in detail. In the end of this paper, a simulation is made which is based on Matlab/Simulink/ Stateflow. Simulation results show that the vehicle can make a turn when only the rear electric axle work. So TRPS can be realized.","","978-1-4244-7737-1","","10.1109/MACE.2010.5535289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5535289","BDCM;driving system;electronic differential;parallel-series","Automotive engineering;Axles;Control systems;Hybrid electric vehicles;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Sliding mode control;Tellurium;Virtual colonoscopy;Wheels","","","","","","0","1","8","","","20100803","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Numeric simulations and parallel parameter optimization is proceeded on Matlab platform. The results demonstrate that the MRC method applied on DCT clutch control can evidently reduce both the jerk shock and frictional loss of dual-clutch operations, which proves MRC method as a wise choice of DCT controlling strategy.

Although advanced solutions for heat removal like Isolated Metal Substrates (IMS) base materials or thermally conductive epoxies have entered the market for a few years they still have a high price tag and add significant manufacturing costs to the finished assembly. Obtaining a good thermal management by using conventional materials and manufacturing techniques is often a key design challenge that engineers have to overcome. By creating thermal paths from one layer to another, the equivalent cooling area for an electronic component can be significantly increased thus lowering the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance which is the main indicator of cooling performance. These thermal paths between layers are commonly defined as through-hole plated vias connected to copper areas. Our paper presents a study of the thermal performances of through-hole thermal vias used for heat transfer between layers on printed circuit boards.

This paper presents a specific sizing model of superconducting propulsion motors to be used in aircraft design. The model also takes into account the cooling system. The requirements for this application are presented in terms of power and dynamics as well as a load profile corresponding to a typical mission. We discuss the design implications of using a superconducting motor on an aircraft as well as the integration of the electrical propulsion in the aircraft, and the scaling laws derived from physics-based modeling of HTS motors.","1051-8223","","","10.1109/TASC.2005.849616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440105","Aircraft design;all-electric aircraft;electric propulsion;superconducting motor","Aerospace engineering;Aircraft propulsion;Application software;Automotive engineering;High temperature superconductors;Military aircraft;Power system modeling;Superconducting filaments and wires;System performance;Vehicles","aircraft;cooling;electric machines;high-temperature superconductors;mobile communication;propulsion;superconducting devices","HTS motors;aircraft design;aircraft propulsion;complex system;computer models;cooling system;electric aircrafts;electrical propulsion;electrical rotating machinery;high current densities;high power density superconducting motors;high temperature superconducting wires;mobile systems;multivariable optimization;physics-based modeling;sizing model;superconducting propulsion motors","","","","12","","3","","","20050613","","IEEE","The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They cause horizontal accelerations in the chassis and the passenger compartment, which may lessen comfort and driveability to an unacceptable extent. These oscillations are usually reduced by so-called 'anti-jerk functions' which combine feedback and feedforward control. In practice, the anti-jerk controller parameters are experimentally optimized to combine comfort with sportiness. Such a procedure requires time-consuming driving tests. Alternatively, this paper proposes a model-based approach. The optimal values for feedback control are investigated by simulation in order to reduce time-expensive driving experiments. The simulation is based on a model of driveline dynamics. The model parameters are estimated from measurement data by means of an extended Kalman-filter or a non-linear least-squares optimization procedure. Besides the modelling and identification approach, the results of the model-based controller design are presented. The concept has been validated experimentally on different diesel cars","","0-7803-9712-6","0-7803-9713-4","10.1109/ICMECH.2006.252510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018345","","Acceleration;Accelerometers;Automotive engineering;Diesel engines;Feedback control;Mechatronics;Testing;Torque;Vehicle dynamics;Wheels","Kalman filters;control engineering computing;feedback;feedforward;identification;least squares approximations;modelling;optimisation;vehicle dynamics","Bonanza effect;antijerk controller design;car driveline dynamics;chassis;diesel cars;driveline jerking;driveline judder;driveline oscillations;extended Kalman-filter;feedback control;feedforward control;model-based controller design;nonlinear least-squares optimization;passenger compartment","","","","3","1","9","","","20061204","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three failure modes (hard failure mode, noise failure mode, and scale failure mode) of the sensor are handled; on the hard failure the sensor output is stuck at a constant value. The noise failure causes the sensor output with large noise. On the scale failure the gain (scale) of the sensor output differs from the normal. The detection and diagnosis of the hard/noise failure (HNFDD) is based on the variable structure interacting multiple-model (VSIMM) estimator; changes of the failure modes are modeled as switching from one mode to another in a probabilistic manner. The mode probabilities, which are estimated based on a bank of Kalman filters, provide the fault decision. The detection and diagnosis of the scale failure (SFDD) is achieved via single-model based Kalman filters, each of which is based on a model matching to a failure mode of particular sensors; the fault decision is made by comparing the model conditional estimates in the sensor gain. The proposed FDD algorithm is implemented on our skid-steered mobile robot with five internal sensors (four wheel-encoders and one yaw-rate gyro). Experimental results show the property of the FDD algorithm.","","0-7803-7860-1","","10.1109/IROS.2003.1249744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249744","","Automotive engineering;Design engineering;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Mechanical sensors;Mechanical systems;Mobile robots;Sensor systems;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","Kalman filters;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;mobile robots;probabilistic logic;probability;sensors","Kalman filters;fault decision;fault detection;fault diagnosis;hard failure mode;hard/noise failure;internal sensors;mobile robots;noise failure mode;probabilistic manner;probability;scale failure mode;sensor gain;variable structure interacting multiple model estimator;wheel encoders;yaw rate gyro","","","","12","","","","","20031203","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, MM20 extends its application range from low-voltage LDMOS devices up to high-voltage LDMOS devices of about 100V. In this paper, the new dc model of MM20, including quasi-saturation, is presented. The addition of velocity saturation in the drift region ensures the current to be controlled by either the channel region or the drift region. A comparison with dc measurements on a 60-V LDMOS device shows that the new model provides an accurate description in all regimes of operation, ranging from subthreshold to superthreshold, in both the linear and saturation regime. Thus, owing to the inclusion of quasi-saturation also the regime of high-gate and high-drain bias conditions for high-voltage LDMOS devices is accurately described.","0018-9383","","","10.1109/TED.2006.870423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610925","High-voltage MOS;LDMOS;integrated-circuit design;modeling;quasi-saturation","Automotive engineering;Capacitance;Circuit simulation;Computer science;Convergence;Laboratories;MOSFETs;Mathematics;Velocity control","MISFET;power integrated circuits;surface potential","60 V;MOS Model 20;compact modeling;compact transistor;dc measurement;drift region;high voltage LDMOS;quasi saturation;surface potential;velocity saturation","","","","24","","17","","","20060327","","IEEE","IEEE Electron Devices Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The validity of the simulation and/or verification results on the model is retained only if the generated code is guaranteed to preserve model semantics. At the same time, the implementation must make efficient use of the execution platform resources. One of the essential issues for efficient implementation is the use of communication buffers that exploit the multirate behavior of the components. In most embedded devices, RAM memory is scarce and buffer size should be kept at a minimum. We present an approach to buffer size optimization by using timing information about the components.

The Flexray protocol provides a globally synchronized time base and has provisions for a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based transmit model (static segment) and a priority based transmit model (dynamic segment). The challenging aspect about Flexray is leveraging its degree of flexibility. Just configuring the dynamic segment alone involves ten protocol level parameters, each of which has significant affect on various key performance metrics such as the message transmission latency, number of message overwrites and bus utilization. This paper presents results from sensitivity analysis for these key parameters relative to the various performance metrics. The results seem to indicate that the assumed notion of message priority as being the main driver that affects transmission latency is far from accurate. Also, the results clearly indicate that one of the in-built protocol constraints has a major detrimental effect on the performance metrics.

International norms like ISO 26262 and IEC 61165 postulate methods for the development and verification of safety critical systems. These standards should ensure that the dependability and quality of the embedded systems is maintained while their complexity and interdependence increases. Yet, the standards do not contain concrete methods or tools for their fulfillment. As concerns classic techniques for dependability analysis they either base on system analysis by means of Markov analysis or on reliability estimation from a usage perspective. Treating the system only from one perspective, however, is a drawback as the system analysis neglects functional or non-functional dependences of the system. These dependences can directly influence the reliability in the field usage. In this paper we present our approach to combine component dependency models with usage models to overcome these deficiencies. It is possible to identify usage scenarios which aim for critical dependences and to analyze the interaction of components inside the system. On the other hand usage scenarios can be assessed whether they meet the desired verification purpose. The component dependency models reveal dependences that were not identified before, because it allows the extraction of implications across functional and non functional dependences like memory, timing and processor utilization.","","978-1-61284-818-1","978-1-61284-819-8","10.1109/SIES.2011.5953678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953678","Automated Testing;Dependability;Fault Tolerance;Road Vehicles;Safety Critical Systems;Software Testing;System Design;Validation;Verification","Reliability;Safety;Software;Testing;Timing;Unified modeling language","IEC standards;ISO standards;Markov processes;automotive engineering;embedded systems;formal verification;road safety;safety-critical software","IEC 61165 norm;ISO 26262 norm;Markov analysis;component dependency model;dependability analysis;embedded systems;memory utilization;model-based verification;processor utilization;reliability estimation;safety-critical systems;timing utilization;vehicle comfortability;vehicle efficiency;vehicle safety","","","","3","","17","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a structured light camera based 3D visual perception and tracking system application with robot arm grasping for manufacturing. In the first step, we use a geometric surface primitive patch segmentation approach based on Hough transforms to obtain accurate surface normal estimations from 3D point clouds for the identification of patch primitives. The most relevant primitives for our application include planar and cylindrical surface patches. We extract primitive surface patches from automotive CAD models in DXF or 3DS format. The models are then decomposed to simple entities such as planar polygons, vertexes and lines. Our system takes advantage of the available CAD data for both object recognition and for pose estimation. In the final step, we propose point based KLT tracking method with dominant features from object recognition results both raw data and CAD. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can show application results from YASKAWA MOTOMAN robots demonstration. Whole processes perform within few seconds, an accurate pose and reasonable tracking.","","978-1-4799-1656-6","","10.1109/ISAM.2013.6643524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6643524","Hough Transform;KTL Tracking;Object Recognition;Pose Estimation;Surface Patch Primitives Segmentation","Design automation;Estimation;Robots;Solid modeling;Surface treatment;Three-dimensional displays;Vectors","CAD;Hough transforms;automobile industry;image sensors;industrial manipulators;object recognition;object tracking;pose estimation;robot vision","3D point clouds;3D vision-based recognition;3DS format;DXF;Hough transforms;YASKAWA MOTOMAN robots;automotive CAD models;complex object grasping;cylindrical surface patches;geometric surface primitive patch segmentation approach;manufacturing;object recognition results;planar surface patches;point based KLT tracking method;pose estimation;robot arm grasping;robot grasping task;robotic pick-and-place operations;structured light camera base 3D visual perception;surface normal estimations;tracking application system","","","","0","","","","","20131024","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two different approaches are considered: (i) a hybrid MPC design based on the full two- mass model, and (ii) a switched MPC control design, which switches between two simpler hybrid MPC controllers, one for the case in which the masses are moving in contact, and the other case where the masses are decoupled, commanded by a simple switching logic.

The hybrid drive train consists of only low-cost components, such as a flywheel module and a continuously variable transmission. This hybrid drive train is characterized by a relatively small energy capacity (flywheel) and discrete shifts between operation modes, due to the use of clutches. The main design criterion of the optimized EMS is the minimization of the overall fuel consumption, over a pre-defined driving cycle. In addition, comfort criteria are formulated as constraints, e.g., to avoid high-frequent shifting between driving modes. The criteria are used to find the optimal sequence of driving modes and the generated engine torque.

In addition, in a model-based design flow, the results of the model validation and verification are retained only if the code implementation preserves the semantic properties of interest. Since AUTOSAR does not support the modeling of the internal behavior of runnables, the most likely candidate for the development of the functions behavior is Simulink, which is based on a Synchronous Reactive semantics. Commercial code generation tools offer solutions for preserving the signal flows exchanged among model blocks allocated to the same core, but do not scale to multicore systems.

The model driven architecture is a design methodology addressing these emerging requirements. Developing embedded systems according to this model-based paradigm requires a platform-independent representation of the functionality of the application as well as a precise model of the targeted hardware platform. In this paper we introduce a meta-model for capturing the resources of hardware platforms realizing the DECOS architecture, which is an integrated time-triggered architecture aimed at the development of distributed embedded systems. Furthermore, we present a tool chain based on this meta-model that speeds up the modeling process and reduces the likelihood of human errors by facilitating the reuse of hardware building blocks from libraries","","0-7695-2561-X","","10.1109/ISORC.2006.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630462","","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Costs;Design methodology;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Humans;Libraries;Real time systems","embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;software reusability;systems analysis","DECOS integrated architecture;distributed embedded systems;hardware platforms;model driven architecture;software reuse;time-triggered architecture","","","","3","","","","","20060515","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The role of the fractional order controller is to introduce frequency-dependent damping of the forced oscillation of the system caused hills and valleys as well as by small dips and bumps on the road.

In addition, the step of Grey predictor is adjusted by using the fuzzy control to satisfy the control requirement. Consequently, the control system fastens rising time, shortens settling time, reduces steady state error to zero, oppresses overshoot of transient response, and also prevents disturbance. A detailed specification of the control structure and its design process as well as simulation results achieved from Matlab/Simulink program are also presented.

DELTA 2008. 4th IEEE International Symposium on","23-25 Jan. 2008","2008","","","216","221","An increasing number of integrated circuits are going into the automotive sector where requirements on dependability are very high. As a result, there is a strong push in the semiconductor industry for achieving higher reliability standards while maintaining (or even lowering) the associated cost. Lately two efficient approaches to increase the effectiveness of reliability testing (including burn-in) have emerged. The first involves additional reliability test insertions. It is quite effective but limited to specific technology and processes. A more robust approach is to screen out devices with latent defects at probe (wafer level) through appropriate selection criteria before devices reach burn-in at the package- level. Traditional six-sigma quality assurance procedures are inadequate in coping with the fabrication process variations because the process is not static. Dynamic parts average testing (PAT) has been introduced by the Automotive Electronics Council to identify abnormal parts from a large population mean. It is the first standard procedure that deviates from the traditional six-sigma approach. Independent studies by Intel and IBM have shown that a die-level reliability predictor can screen unreliable devices better than dynamic PAT (which is based on a lot-level methodology). However, the die-level predictive model is relatively new and thus it needs further investigation to prove its usability in different technology and process settings. This paper studies the die-level predictive model for a specific wafer fabrication technology and critically assesses its performance and feasibility for implementation in a real-world production testing.","","978-0-7695-3110-6","","10.1109/DELTA.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459543","burn-in;integrated circuits;reliability;wafer testing;yield modelling","Automotive engineering;Costs;Electronic equipment testing;Electronics industry;Fabrication;Integrated circuit reliability;Maintenance;Predictive models;Semiconductor device reliability;Vehicle dynamics","semiconductor device manufacture;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability","automotive electronics council;automotive sector;deep submicron devices;die level predictive model;dynamic parts average testing;predictive die level;reliability testing;reliability yield modeling;semiconductor industry;six sigma approach;wafer fabrication technology","","","","2","","7","","","20080303","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It enables the combination of an abstracted, system level view with highly accurate models of different components, and thus supports the analysis and validation of the embedded system. In this work we present an approach based on the inter-language run-time switching of simulation models during co-simulation. This new method enables long-time system level simulation with dynamic (user defined) switches to more accurate models for the punctual analysis of low level effects.

Two principal program changes are discussed - the integration and coordination of the two separate design programs to work on a single project and the addition of a parallel graduate-level design course. The program merger has yielded a stronger and more relevant student experience as well as better autonomous vehicle quality. It has also required the navigation of differences in design methodology, grading structures, and department/discipline cultures. The introduction of a graduate design course provided a strong multi-cultural influence and much needed technical sophistication that directly contributed to increased success at the competition. In this work then, we present the resulting design course structure and process, and provide a frank treatment of the associated successes and challenges.","0190-5848","978-1-4244-1083-5","978-1-4244-1084-2","10.1109/FIE.2007.4417956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417956","Capstone Design;Competition-Based Capstone Program;Interdisciplinary Education;Multidisciplinary Education","Automotive engineering;Corporate acquisitions;Design engineering;Design methodology;Land vehicles;Mechanical engineering;Mobile robots;Navigation;Product development;Remotely operated vehicles","educational courses;electrical engineering education;mechanical engineering","University of Detroit Mercy;autonomous vehicle quality;capstone design program;electrical and computer engineering;graduate-level design course;mechanical engineering;multicultural competition;multidisciplinary competition","","","","0","","4","","","20080104","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The process uses modeling to systematize architecture selection and conceptual design, using low fidelity, carefully scoped models. The course focuses on using the process to develop a novel, complex space system architecture to address a realistic need. The course was successful in both implementing the process and accelerating learning. An analysis reveals that it moves intuition-based decisions forward, from choosing the design (difficult for students, and limiting in terms of creative designs) to defining the models used to evaluate potential designs, and scoping of the design space explored.

The present paper aims at proposing a methodological approach for assessing a suitable power rating of the requisite energy sources for the vehicle propelling. Based on a Markov matrix formulation, a vehicle mission modeling technique is proposed, stochastic mission profiles are generated and the dominant one is identified. Then a sizing algorithm is implemented in order to minimize the fuel consumption on that most constraining mission. The application on several kinds of vehicle mission natures will then be proposed and discussed so as to show their impact on the traction chain sizing.","","978-1-4577-1494-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6028285","Automotive applications;Energy consumption;Energy management;Hybrid power systems;Land vehicles;Markov processes;Power system modeling;Power system simulation;Stochastic systems","Batteries;Engines;Generators;Hybrid power systems;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Vehicles","Markov processes;hybrid electric vehicles;stochastic processes;traction","Markov matrix formulation;air pollution;energy saving purpose;energy source;engine vehicle;fuel consumption minimization;hybrid electric vehicle;petroleum supply;power rating;power source sizing algorithm;standard driving cycle;stochastic mission profile;traction chain sizing;vehicle electrification;vehicle mission modeling technique;vehicle propelling","","","","1","","14","","","20110926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This design proposal is a didactic model that seeks to illustrate the stages of the design and, mainly, the digital system for control the movements of the mechanical arm. For this case,the mechanical design of the arm does not depend on a specific trajectory, it is a free trajectory and user can decide, trough the FPGA interface, the mechanical arm movement. The mechanical arm proposal does not have the capacity to exercise big forces, not to lift big weight, but rather it seeks to be an easy construction model and accessible for everyone, since it can be built until with recycled material, just as it was made in this case, for educational purposes.","","978-0-7695-3320-9","","10.1109/CERMA.2008.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641121","Digital System;FPGA;VHDL;mechanical arm;stepper-motor","Control systems;Digital control;Digital systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Power electronics;Power system interconnection;Power system modeling;Process design;Proposals","field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;manipulators;power electronics","FPGA;VHDL;didactic model;digital system control;field programmable gate array;mechanical arm;power electronic circuit","","","","0","","6","","","20081010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, new algorithms and methodologies like static parameter assignment and counterexample guided simulation are proposed in order to combine simulation-based and formal verification in a new way.

In this paper, nonlinear local model networks are used to obtain dynamic battery models with high fidelity that can be computed in real time. This approach also allows the extraction of local linear impedance models for high-bandwidth impedance emulation, leading to a tighter coupling between the test bed and simulation model with predictable closed-loop dynamics. A model predictive controller that achieves optimal control with adherence to system constraints is extended to impedance control and robustness against constant power loads. This results not only in superior dynamic performance but also in stable dc-bus voltage control even for testing of tightly controlled electric motor inverters with negative differential input resistance. Since the controller design is based on a model of the test bed setup including the virtual battery model, emulator hardware, and input characteristics of the powertrain under test, it is possible to systematically analyze stability.","0278-0046","","","10.1109/TIE.2013.2253070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6482215","Automotive applications;dc–dc power converters;electric vehicles;predictive control;robust stability;test equipment","Batteries;Computational modeling;Emulation;Impedance;Integrated circuit modeling;Load modeling;Voltage control","battery powered vehicles;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;hybrid electric vehicles;invertors;load flow control;nonlinear dynamical systems;optimal control;power transmission (mechanical);predictive control;robust control;voltage control","DC power supply control;DC-bus voltage control;battery emulation;closed loop dynamics;constant power load;dynamic battery model;dynamic impedance emulation;electric motor inverter control;hardware-in-the-loop;hybrid electric vehicle;linear impedance model;model predictive controller;nonlinear characteristic emulation;nonlinear local model network;optimal control;power HIL;power flow emulation;powertrain under test;robust impedance control;stability analysis;virtual battery model","","","","1","","59","","2013-03-19","20130815","","IEEE","IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hybrid powertrains for military applications offer the potential for improved fuel economy, enhanced stealth (silent operation) capability, and auxiliary field power generation. While recent hybrid electric HMMWV conversions have shown impressive performance, the likely estimated production cost is high. In cooperation with the National Automotive Center (part of the United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, TECOM), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and The University of Tennessee (UT) have conducted a conceptual design for a low production cost hybrid electric powertrain for the HMMWV. The design takes maximum advantage of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology. The parallel, electric assist configuration offers hybrid performance equivalent to the conventional base vehicle for limited time periods, silent electric operation, and limp-home capability in the event of electric drive system failure. The design goals for the hybrid electric powertrain, the overall system design, and design decisions necessary to meet performance goals are reviewed. Performance simulation results show that the proposed powertrain design should meet or exceed the stated design goals","","0-7803-5086-3","","10.1109/DASC.1998.739883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=739883","","Automotive engineering;Costs;Fuel economy;Hidden Markov models;Laboratories;Mechanical power transmission;Power generation;Power generation economics;Production;Vehicles","economics;electric vehicles;military equipment","National Automotive Center;Oak Ridge National Laboratory;University of Tennessee;auxiliary field power generation;commercial off-the-shelf technology;electric assist configuration;fuel efficiency;high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle;hybrid HMMWV;hybrid powertrains;limp-home capability;military vehicles;production cost;silent electric operation;system design","","","","1","","8","","","20020806","31 Oct 1998-07 Nov 1998","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

IECON '09. 35th Annual Conference of IEEE","3-5 Nov. 2009","2009","","","1823","1828","In this paper we present an occupant detection system based on a capacitive sensing technique. The capacitive detector is designed to distinguish between an empty and occupied vehicle seat. Additionally, the coupling between the seated passenger and the car-body can be investigated. This occupant detection system provides valuable additional information for airbag controlling system. By launching airbags well matched and controlled, the injuring risk of a passenger can be minimized in case of a car crash. In comparison to standard pressure sensors capacitive sensors are contactless and have no wearing parts [1], this leads to economic benefits. The detector operates in a frequency range between 50 kHz and 5 MHz with 5 mV<sub>RMS</sub> sine signals, by using a precision impedance analyzer. In our laboratory setup, the car seat measuring assembly is shielded by a copper chassis cage which can be connected either to the low or high-potential of the impedance analyzer or can be kept floating. This feature enables us to analyze the effect of the variable passenger to ground coupling. Each of the 16 sensor electrodes, located at the backrest and seating surface area, can be switched to low potential, high potential or can be left unconnected during a measurement. In order to determine the posture of the passenger body, we record coupling capacitances between single electrode pairs. Furthermore impedance characteristics over a wide frequency range can be analyzed based on appropriate impedance models in order to receive more information about the occupancy status of the car seat.","1553-572X","978-1-4244-4648-3","978-1-4244-4650-6","10.1109/IECON.2009.5414836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5414836","","Capacitive sensors;Control systems;Detectors;Electrodes;Frequency;Signal analysis;Surface impedance;Vehicle crash testing;Vehicle detection;Vehicles","automotive components;capacitive sensors;pressure sensors;road safety","airbag controlling system;capacitive detector;capacitive sensing technique;capacitive sensors;contactless seat occupation detection system;electric field sensing;impedance analyzer;pressure sensors","","","","0","1","11","","","20100217","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major challenge is the determination of optimal routings with respect to these objectives. Existing automatic optimization approaches carry out a two step optimization: First, they perform a multi-objective topology optimization of the networked embedded system. Then, a multi-objective routing optimization for a subset of Pareto optimal solutions obtained from the first step is performed. In general, this may exclude several globally optimal solutions from the optimization process. To overcome this drawback, a unified approach based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is presented that ensures a combined optimization of the topology and routing. Since the system topology is varied within the optimization, the main contribution of this paper contribution is a novel routing technique that always samples feasible paths using a topology independent genetic encoding. This encoding preserves optimized routing information when changing the underlying topology. An experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the presented approach.","","978-1-4244-1985-2","","10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664849","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664849","","Aerospace electronics;Automotive engineering;Computer networks;Decoding;Embedded system;Encoding;Evolutionary computation;Network topology;Resource management;Routing","Pareto optimisation;embedded systems;evolutionary computation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","Pareto optimal solutions;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective routing;multiple design objectives;networked embedded systems;topology optimization","","","","0","","22","","","20081105","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a commonly accepted notion that a product development process (PDP) depends upon at least three key basic elements: organizational design; people and prevailing culture; and technology. Each element influences the PDP differently and to varying degrees, based upon the element's characteristics and associated time constant (i.e., the time it requires to take root and begin exerting influence in a significant manner). This paper mainly examines ways in which technology influences the PDP. Within that context, it then considers how the pace of technology evolution (slow, medium and fast) potentially impacts the product development process. It then addresses the issues related to investments required for the deployment of technology for process improvement. Finally, it examines the bounds or limits of technological influence on the PDP in terms of cost reduction and lead time","","0-7803-3574-0","","10.1109/PICMET.1997.653459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=653459","","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Collaboration;Computer displays;Costs;Product design;Product development;Vehicles;Virtual environment;Visualization","product development;research and development management","cost reduction;innovation management;lead time;organizational design;people;prevailing culture;process improvement;product development process;technology deployment investment;technology evolution pace;technology influence","","","","0","","","","","20020806","27 Jul 1997-31 Jul 1997","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the issue of designing a SbW system is faced. An approach is proposed, based on three steps. Firstly, the model of a conventional steering system is formulated. Then the SbW system is developed with the same structure as the conventional ones. Finally, performance indexes for the steering maneuver are defined and utilized to set up the parameters of the SbW system. As a case of study, the SbW system of a lift truck is designed according to the proposed approach. Diagrams are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resultant SbW system","","0-7803-9484-4","","10.1109/ICIT.2005.1600679","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1600679","Industrial Vehicles;Steer-by-Wire Systems;Steering System Modeling","Computer science;Road safety;Road vehicles;Shafts;Steering systems;Torque;Turning;Vehicle driving;Vehicle safety;Wheels","automotive components;steering systems;wheels","handwheel rotation;road wheels;steer-by-wire system design;steering effort;steering systems","","","","2","","7","","","20060306","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a design for a fish model consisting of three rigid body links and employing a two degree of freedom, non-reciprocal, movement which propels the fish through a perfect fluid without the use of a Kutta condition to shed vortices. In a companion paper we present results for a second fish model based on a Joukowski airfoil which has only one degree of freedom in its movement, and thus relies on vortex shedding to move through a perfect fluid. With the use of extremum seeking, we achieve the same results in each case: The fish is capable of performing dasiasource seekingpsila in GPS-denied underwater environments, and, if position measurement is available, it is capable of navigating from point A to point B, as well as along a predetermined path.","0743-1619","978-1-4244-4523-3","978-1-4244-4524-0","10.1109/ACC.2009.5160256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5160256","","Aerospace engineering;Automotive components;Deformable models;Marine animals;Navigation;Performance evaluation;Position measurement;Propulsion;Shape control;Underwater vehicles","mobile robots;motion control;underwater vehicles","GPS;Joukowski airfoil;Kutta condition;fish locomotion;locomotion control;nonholonomic mobile robots;source seeking control;underwater vehicles;vortex shedding","","","","1","","17","","","20090710","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Starting with a variants system specification including a set of task graphs, linear constraints on binary variables are specified for their alternative selection as well as the selection of groups of alternatives called application groups. These constraints may stem from a certain domain knowledge, e. g., entertainment or power train domain, or global constraints. The typically vast space of resulting possible combinations of different selections of alternative behaviors will be termed variant space and those satisfying the set of formulated constraints valid variants. An important result of this paper is that the set of variants, and especially the set of valid variants, do not need to be modeled or stored explicitly but rather implicitly. Nevertheless do we show that using state-of-the-art PB solver techniques, we may determine the set of valid variants very efficiently. Each of these valid variants may subsequently be used as a candidate for design space exploration (DSE) in order to optimize also the mapping of the corresponding task graph functionalities to a final optimized E/E architecture. A real-world case study is provided to demonstrate the capabilities and efficiency of the presented approach on implicit variant modeling and analysis.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659011","","Automotive engineering;Business;Computer architecture;Hardware;Sensors;Software;Space exploration","automotive electronics;design engineering;embedded systems;graph theory;mechanical engineering computing","DSE;IVaM;PB solver techniques;automotive embedded systems;design space exploration;electric-and-electronic architecture functionality;electronic control units;functional variant analysis;functional variant modeling;global business knowledge;graph-based approach;group selection;implicit variant modeling-and-management;linear constraints;local technical expert knowledge;task graph functionalities","","","","0","","","","","20131111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, developing efficient algorithms for AGV routing on the mesh topology has become an important research topic. In this paper, we present a discrete time model, based on which a simple routing algorithm on the mesh topology is presented. The algorithm works by carefully choosing suitable parameters such that the vehicles using a same junction will arrive at different points in time, and hence no conflicts will occur during the routing; meanwhile, high routing performance can be achieved.

Such inverters need more number of switches and two stages of power conversion. This work proposes a novel dc to ac boost based on sinusoidal-pulse-width-modulation (SPWM) control which generates output in single stage and whose peak value can be greater than the dc input one depending on the instantaneous duty cycle. This property is not found in the classical VSI, which produces an ac output voltage always lower than the dc input voltage. The proposed inverter performs single stage power conversion, which minimizes switching losses and attains higher efficiency as compared with conventional boost inverter, in spite of the 35% reduction in the number of switches. This paper describes a new PWM strategy for proposed boost inverter. This modulation strategy reduces the energy loss and harmonics in the proposed inverter. This technique allows the proposed inverter to become a new feasible solution for many applications like PV systems, automotive electronics, solar home applications and other power supply systems.","","978-1-4244-8678-6","978-1-4244-8679-3","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941678","Boost inverter;inverter and sinusoidal-pulse-width-modulation","Capacitors;Control systems;Integrated circuit modeling;Inverters;Pulse width modulation","DC-AC power convertors;PWM power convertors;invertors;power conversion harmonics;switching convertors;uninterruptible power supplies","automotive electronics;boost DC-AC converter;boost inverters;energy loss;instantaneous duty cycle;power conversion harmonics;single stage power conversion;sinusoidal-pulse-width-modulation;solar home;switching loss;uninterruptible power supply","","","","0","","12","","","20110707","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using cellular automaton models, our work has taken the non-lane based behaviors of nonmotorized vehicles into account, which has not been considered in previous works. We have investigated flow rates of the system. The traffic state diagram and the spatiotemporal pattern are presented as the inflow rates of motorized vehicles and nonmotorized vehicles change. Traffic interactions between motorized vehicles and nonmotorized vehicles may cause congestions in traffic flow at dense flow, but has no influence at sparse flow.

Even though the protocol is well understood, implementing its physical layer is becoming more and more challenging. Vehicle manufacturers have decided to replace current low speed CAN implementations with high speed CAN solutions. This is a requirement of the increasing bus load. The number of electronic control units increases for individual CAN high speed sub-networks which makes it more challenging to ensure a robust implementation of the targeted network topology. A manual verification of the In-Vehicle network's signal integrity in the early stage of development, where no hardware prototypes are available, is not possible due to its high transient behavior. The only choice to verify prototype topologies is through a model based design flow. A virtual In-Vehicle network implementation allows the early verification of physical layer robustness before any hardware prototypes are built-up. This allows the network developer to discover any possible issues very early and to fix them without changing any hardware implementations. This paper gives an overview of the challenges network developers face when dealing with the physical layer implementation. In addition it shows how to develop a robust implementation through a model based design method, taking into account environmental variations and component tolerances to ensure the system works even under worst case conditions.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-815-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383635","CAN;signal integrity;vehicle topology","","","","","","","0","","","","","20071119","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

This entails serializing both communication and computation which does not necessarily meet the assumptions made by the application. Hence, we present the concept of executable formal specification of general TT systems to establish a faithful model of the TT characteristics. Our focus is on general applications running in a synchronous environment. The proposed model can be easily customized by the user and it is able to support simulation and verification of the system.

The yaw moment calculated by yaw moment controller is realized by TVD model with distributing vectoring torque from left to right wheel. In the end, a hardware-in-loop simulation (HILS) system simulating the rear wheel and axle equipped with TVD is introduced to combine with the vehicle model, the virtual controller, virtual instrument by LabVIEW and the experiment platform for transmission. The HILS results show that TVD system compared with Electronic Stability Program (ESP) can restrain the sideslip angle and yaw rate within their desired value without the deterioration of the longitudinal performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of TVD system for enhance vehicle cornering performance by vectoring torque is also guaranteed in simulation validation.","","978-1-61284-485-5","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6014272","electronic stability program;hardware-in-loop simulation;torque vectoring differential;vehicle stability control","Acceleration;Automotive engineering;Axles;Hardware;Powders;Vehicles","automotive engineering;axles;control engineering computing;control system synthesis;fuzzy control;mechanical engineering computing;power transmission (mechanical);road vehicles;stability;steering systems;torque control;vehicle dynamics;wheels","LabVIEW;Simulink;axle;four-wheel-drive vehicle model;fuzzy logic control structure;hardware-in-loop simulation;rear wheel;sideslip angle;torque steering;torque vectoring differential system;transmission;veDYNA;vehicle cornering performance;vehicle stability control;vehicle steerability;virtual controller;virtual instrument;yaw moment controller;yaw rate","","","","0","","8","","","20110908","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper reports on the development of a computer simulation model to develop an efficient waypoint-based navigation algorithm for a Korean tillage tractor. The computer simulation environment was built based on the kinematic motion of a tractor and the characteristics of tire slippage and side force by soil on a curved path. The validity of the simulation program was confirmed by a driving test using a Tong Yang TX 803 tractor equipped with a RTK-GPS receiver and a steering controller. In the validation test, the developed algorithm for real-time path tracking provided tracking trajectories similar to those obtained from the computer simulation. However, a study on an oscillation in steering angles when the tractor travelled on a straight path was needed. In future work, various parameters related to path tracking, such as waypoints, waypoint intervals, LBO (Limit of Boundary Offset), and traveling velocity will be optimized using the developed computer simulator.","2093-7121","978-89-93215-05-2","","10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6704165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6704165","Autonomous tractor;Computer simulation;Kinematic model;Model validation;Tire slippage;Tracking algorithm","Automotive engineering;Design automation;Engines;IP networks;Robot sensing systems","Global Positioning System;agricultural machinery;digital simulation;mobile robots;path planning;radio receivers;real-time systems;robot kinematics;slip;soil;steering systems;tyres;vehicle dynamics","Korean tillage tractor;LBO;RTK-GPS receiver;Tong Yang TX 803 tractor;agricultural operations;autoguidance tractor system;computer simulation model;curved path;driving test;fixed spacing;limit of boundary offset;optimal coverage path planning;oscillation;parallel path;real-time path tracking algorithms;side force;simulation program validity;soil;steering angles;steering controller;tire slippage characteristics;tracking trajectories;tractor kinematic motion;traveling velocity;waypoint intervals;waypoint tracking;waypoint-based navigation algorithm","","","","0","","","","","20140109","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The control method is constructed by two models designed based on fuzzy-neural technique, a nonlinear black-box model (BBM) and an inverse black-box model (IBBM). By employing a fuzzy mapping system optimized by neural network technique including back-propagation and gradient descent method, the BBM model can estimate directly the damper characteristics. The inverse model, IBBM with self-learning ability, was then derived based on the BBM with the optimized parameters and neural network technique. Consequently, the designed BBM and IBBM models can be used as a `virtual' force sensor and an adaptive force controller, respectively, to perform a closed-loop feedback control for any damping system which uses the corresponding MR fluid damper. Effectiveness of the proposed models for modeling as well as the force-sensorless damping control technique has been clearly verified through simulations and real-time experiments on two vibrating systems employing the same MR fluid damper series.","2093-7121","978-1-4577-0835-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106181","Black-box model (BBM);Force-sensorless damping control;Identification;Inverse black-box model (IBBM);Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid damper","Adaptation models;Control systems;Damping;Fluids;Force;Niobium;Shock absorbers","adaptive control;backpropagation;closed loop systems;damping;feedback;force control;force sensors;fuzzy control;fuzzy neural nets;gradient methods;magnetorheology;nonlinear control systems;vibration control","BBM model;MR fluid damper;adaptive force controller;backpropagation;closed-loop feedback control;damping system;force-sensorless damping control;fuzzy mapping system;fuzzy-neural technique;gradient descent method;inverse black-box model;magnetorheological fluid damper;neural network;nonlinear black-box model;self-learning ability;semi-active control device;vibrating system;virtual force sensor","","","","0","","8","","","20111219","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Focusing on optimizing fuel economy of the vehicle, five main issues are studied in this paper. Firstly, based on the analyses of resistances for the STACV in a sandy loam working condition, a theoretical model for fuel consumption of 100 km, which is an evaluation index for fuel economy, is established. Secondly, through simplified by a group of constraint equations based on the physical structure of the vehicle, the running parameters and control target (fuel consumption of 100 km) could be expressed by the following two measurable and adjustable parameters, fan rotational speed and vehicle forward speed. Thirdly, a genetic algorithms (GA) model is designed to optimize the fuel consumption and to get the relevant parameters off line as control objectives of status variables of a control system. Fourthly, the control system with a fuzzy PID controller and a GA-based PID controller is built to achieve the minimal fuel consumption by regulating fan rotational speed and vehicle forward speed respectively. Fifthly, simulations are performed in a MATLAB/Simulink software environment. The result illustrates that this control system works efficiently and steadily.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677507","GA-based PID;fuel consumption of 100km;fuel economy;fuzzy PID;genetic algorithms;semi-track air-cushion vehicle","Control systems;Defense industry;Fuel economy;Fuzzy control;Genetic algorithms;Mathematical model;Petroleum;Propulsion;Three-term control;Vehicles","fuel economy;fuzzy control;genetic algorithms;three-term control;vehicles","air-cushion lifting system;fan rotational speed;fuel consumption;fuel economy optimization;fuzzy PID controller;fuzzy control;genetic algorithms;heavy-duty vehicles;semitrack air-cushion vehicle;semitrack propulsion system;vehicle forward speed","","","","0","","10","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This causes waste of investment on the hardware, software, human resources, and also causes inefficiency in the product development and production.

In an open pit mine with a trolley operation, this would be an added feature to the direct trolley and diesel boost application.

Hybrid automata are a widely used framework to model complex critical systems, where continuous physical dynamics are combined with discrete transitions. Application areas include automotive, railway, aerospace, and industrial production. The expressive power of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers can be used to symbolically model networks of hybrid automata, using formulas in the theory of reals. In this tutorial, we survey state-of-the-art SMT-based verification for hybrid systems. We show how SAT-based techniques such as bounded model checking, k-induction, predicate abstraction, and IC3, can be naturally lifted to the SMT case. The expressive power of the SMT framework allows us to exploit a local time semantics, where the timescales of the automata in the network are synchronized upon shared events. The approach fully leverages the advanced features of modern SMT solvers, such as incrementality, unsatisfiable core extraction, and interpolation. We then concentrate on the problem of scenario-based verification, i.e. checking if a network of hybrid automata accepts some desired interactions among the components, expressed as Message Sequence Charts (MSCs). We conclude by investigating the problem of requirements analysis for hybrid systems.","","978-1-4673-4832-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462548","","Abstracts;Aerodynamics;Automata;Computational modeling;Design automation;Feature extraction;Vehicle dynamics","automata theory;computability;formal verification;synchronisation;systems analysis","IC3 technique;MSC;SMT Solvers;aerospace application;automotive application;bounded model checking;complex critical systems;continuous physical dynamics;discrete transitions;hybrid automata;hybrid system verification;industrial production;k-induction technique;local time semantics;message sequence charts;network synchronization;predicate abstraction;railway application;requirements analysis;satisfiability modulo theories;scenario-based verification;state-of-the-art SMT-based verification;symbolic network model","","","","0","","","","","20130218","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normally, the geometry is first sketched in 2-D and then extruded in the third direction to generate a 3-D model. In Pro/E, it is important to first create the base geometry. The base geometry is that geometry that captures the design intent of the part to be modeled. This base geometry can be created using either the EXTRUDE or the REVOLVE options. Once this base geometry has been created, additional features like holes, rounds, chamfers, fillets, ribs, etc can be added in the finishing stages of the part creation. The center of the bowl does not coincide with the center of the cylinder due to the presence of valve pockets. The obvious advantage of this configuration is that is gives the true geometry of the piston and the presence of connecting rod means that the connecting rod ports can be accommodated when the piston is at the top dead center. In addition to the crankshaft with connecting rod, fly gear will also be added. Various instances of this configuration will then be created using the Â¿Family TableÂ¿ option of Pro/E wildfire in an attempt to optimize the engine performance. The presence of the connecting rod will make the mesh creation process more challenging for the modeler. This means that the numerical computation will be more intensive.","","978-1-4244-6388-6","978-1-4244-6389-3","10.1109/ETCS.2010.508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5458916","3-D model;Pro/E;Product families;Virtual Design;the top-down method","Assembly;Engine cylinders;Finishing;Gears;Geometry;Joining processes;Pistons;Ribs;Solid modeling;Valves","CAD/CAM;automotive engineering;computational geometry;engines;gears;pistons;rods (structures);shafts;solid modelling;valves","3-d design;PRO/E software;base geometry;engine performance;fly gear;mesh creation process;piston crankshaft connecting rod;solid model;top-down method;valve pockets","","","","1","","6","","","20100506","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The manipulator dynamics is lifted up to the image space and modeled with the lagrangian formalism by formulating the kinematic and potential energy in the image space. The resulting motion equation has the same structure as that obtained in the joint space using the lagrangian modeling [1], and therefore inheriting the passivity property.

However, the algorithm for SAT(satisfiability test for propositional formula) is not applicable directly for the real-time diagnosis due to its computational complexity. We transform the constraints in sign algebra into the set of the Boolean equations. The diagnosis algorithm is described in the form of logical functions that are parameterized solutions of the equations, and we implement these solutions in logical circuits in order to achieve the more accurate and quick responsible diagnoses.

The development of mobile telephones capable of handling data and the increased availability of wireless networks build up the second basis of mobile diagnosis. Using a suitable IT infrastructure, data can be obtained from the vehicle by every PC. In addition to the data channel, which allows precise vehicle identification and describes the condition of the vehicle, customer complaints can be dealt with over the voice channel and serve as a fundamental source of information. Vehicle data as well as the information from the driver are compared with previously occurred faults in other vehicles. Case based reasoning (CBR) systems applications are identified. The result is a precise ascertainment of the fault cause, from which the defective vehicle components can be determined.

The underwater vehicle response is slow compared to air scenario due to constraints like higher density of water; the resistance motion is many hundred times greater than air. In this paper a rule-based fuzzy logic controller is designed for yaw control, which is used for the rudder movement of an underwater vehicle. A plant model is extracted using the input and output behavior and is assumed to the either linear time invariant first order or second order. Since the plant models obtained by the above process are very approximate, 50% variations are given on damping (xi) and natural frequency (omegan) of second order plant and similarly the gain and time constant are varied for the first order plant.

"Evolving Models of Supplier Involvement in Design: The Deterioration of the Japanese Model in U.S. Auto","Ro, Y.K.; Liker, J.K.; Fixson, S.K.","Univ. of Michigan, Dearborn","Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on","May 2008","2008","55","2","359","377","The U.S. auto industry in the 1990s was in a state of transition, driven by a rapidly changing environment and attempts to adopt best practices from other automakers. The Japanese supplier management system is regarded as extremely effective in delivering high-quality component systems integrated into the vehicle with short design lead times. American automakers dedicated themselves to reengineering their product development systems, benchmarking the Japanese model, and outsourcing increasing levels of vehicle content and design responsibility. This paper analyzes how these attempts at institutional imitation evolved new approaches to supplier involvement in design in the U.S. auto industry based on interviews conducted during 1998-2001. Although once copying the Japanese model, the United States has chosen a modified approach and developed models distinctively different from the original. The authors identify two dominant supplier management models emerging during this time and a newly emerging hybrid original equipment manufacturer/supplier relationship style. Concepts from organizational design and behavioral economic theories are used to explain observations across industries overtime. Evidence suggests that American automaker practices have not evolved to support the great responsibility being outsourced to suppliers. There are still barriers that create adversarial relationships when a partnership model is required for true integration of design efforts.","0018-9391","","","10.1109/TEM.2008.919733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4494746","Automotive;Japanese;module;product development;supplier management;systems integrator","Automobiles;Best practices;Environmental economics;Industrial economics;Industrial relations;Manufacturing industries;Outsourcing;Product development;Vehicles;Virtual manufacturing","automobile industry;outsourcing;product development;supply chain management","Japanese supplier management;U.S. auto industry;automakers;behavioral economic theories;high-quality component systems;organizational design;outsourcing;product development systems;short design lead times","","","","11","1","47","","","20080422","","IEEE","IEEE Technology Management Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Mechatronic systems are developed for mechanical elements, machines, vehicles and precision mechanic devices. The integration of mechatronic systems can be performed by the components (hardware-integration) and by information processing (software-integration). The information processing consists of low-level and high-level feedback control, supervision and diagnosis and general process management. Special signal processing, model based and adaptive methods are applied. With the aid of a knowledge base and inference mechanisms, mechatronic systems with increasing intelligence will be developed. The main goals are to increase systems performance, reliability and economy, and production costs.

A preliminary design is arrived based on the magnetic circuit and power balance equations. Then the Finite Element Analysis of the preliminary design is carried out. It is found from the FEA that the preliminary design can be refined. The major refinement is on shape of the magnet, and minor on shape of the slot and slot width. The different magnets shapes are studied and optimal shape is proposed which reduces the cogging torque.

In the functional design, we identify objects and define classes to realize functions of the target system. In the behavioral design, we determine triggering methods of objects to meet real-time requirements and define them as aspects. The aspects defined in the behavioral design are woven into the classes defined in the functional design. By using our method, we can design triggering methods independently of the functional design. Our method also improves the reusability of a model and source code of the system.

The second is required to isolate the car body from vibrations caused by the high-frequency road profile. Furthermore, the vibration controller is based on a fully adaptive control algorithm. This enables the suspension to auto-tune to different vehicle payloads, tyre stiffnesses and other parameter variations experienced during progressive wear, and to adapt to the varying road frequency spectrum.

The delays may degrade the control performance and may cause system instability. A new performance index (PI) derived from the difference between the performance of a simulated system and the performance of an implemented system with time delays. By using the proposed PI, optimized periods and priorities of tasks and messages of the network-based TCS were determined. In order to verify the performance of the TCS, the designed control system was realized and tested by using a rapid control prototyping (RCP) platform and a hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) environment.

Three areas of structure and function are discussed in this review: 1) the anatomical structure of the fin blade, skeleton, and muscles that drive fin motion; 2) the rowing and flapping motions that fins undergo for propulsion in fishes; and 3) the neuroanatomy, neural circuitry, and electrical muscle activity that are characteristic of pectoral fins. Research on fin biomechanics, muscle physiology and neural control is important to the comparative biology of locomotion in fishes and application of fin function for aid in aquatic vehicle design.

This approach is known as replication. In spite of the number of studies on the topic, designing a replication pattern is still error prone. This is due to the fact that its final behavior is the result of the combination of design decisions that involves reasoning about a collection of non-deterministic events such as hardware failures and parallel computations. In this paper we present an approach to model replication patterns in the architecture analysis and design language (AADL) and analyze potentially unintended behaviors. Such an approach takes advantage of the strong semantics of AADL to model replication patterns at the architecture level. The approach involves developing two AADL models. The first one defines the intended behavior in synchronous call sequences. And the second model describes the replication architecture. These two models are then compared using a differential model in Alloy where the requirements of the first model and the concurrency and potential failure of the second are combined. The additional behaviors discovered in this model are presented to the designer as potential errors in the design. The designer then has the opportunity to modify the replication architecture to correct these behaviors or qualify them as valid behaviors. Finally, we validated our approach by recreating the verification experiment presented in but limiting ourselves to the AADL syntax.","","978-0-7695-3702-3","","10.1109/ICECCS.2009.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090549","AADL;Embedded;Model-Based Development;Model-Based Engineering;Real-Time;Replication;Verification","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Object oriented modeling;Pattern analysis;Runtime;Software engineering;USA Councils","formal verification;software architecture;software fault tolerance;specification languages","AADL;Alloy;architecture analysis and design language;differential model;fault tolerance;formal verification;replication architecture;synchronous call sequence","","","","0","","6","","","20090623","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Robotic manipulators are widely adopted to carry out these processes. If done by human operators, the tool planning for these applications is usually time-consuming and the generated tool plans are prone to inaccuracy and errors. This research develops a fully-automated, CAD-guided tool planning system which eliminates the human involvement. Meanwhile, this system can generate optimized tool plans in the sense of robot motion performance. The critical part of this tool planning system is the partitioning of part surfaces into multiple easy-to-handle patches. In this paper, a decomposition-based approach is developed, which models the surface partitioning problem in geometric domain as an integer programming problem in algebraic domain. Experimental tests and evaluation carried out on automotive parts validate this new approach.","","0-7803-7860-1","","10.1109/IROS.2003.1248977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1248977","","Additives;Coatings;Humans;Manipulators;Manufacturing automation;Manufacturing processes;Motion planning;Painting;Robotics and automation;Spraying","CAD/CAM;automotive components;coatings;manipulators;manufacturing processes;painting;path planning","additive manufacturing processes;algebraic domain;automated CAD-guided tool planning;computer aided design;decomposition-based approach;geometric domain;integer programming problem;multiple easy-to-handle patches;optimized tool plans;rapid tooling;robot motion;robotic manipulators;spray coating;spray painting;surface partitioning;surface partitioning problem","","","","3","","","","","20031203","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be able to achieve this target, dynamical test benches must be used which allow reproducing the load conditions on the engine crankshaft as occurring in the real vehicle. Dynamical testing usually consists in tracking speed versus torque profiles, which represent the expected vehicle operation. This also allows testing conditions which can not be measured in a real vehicle, and can lead to the situation in which the dynamics limit of the test bench and of the combustion engines are trespassed. This often leads to a chaotic performance of the test bench and to unreliable results. To cope with this problem we present an online capable algorithm which ensures that the test cycle is inside the performance limits. The algorithms are based on prefiltered design, the computation of feasible sets and of the use of augmented Kalman Filters to enforce feasibility.

The complexity of the geometry, the diverse heat transfer mechanisms involved and the duration of the operating cycle prevent the use of both simple, lumped models and detailed numerical simulations. The TTNM methodology relies instead in steady, approximate heat transfer correlations and a division of the system into the largest possible isothermal elements, based on the analysis of characteristic time and length scales. The dynamic heat balance of each element is then written down, conforming the TTNM of the system, which is numerically integrated with an adequate time step. The practical aspects of the TTNM methodology (design stage) are finally demonstrated; in this particular case-study, the model reveals a very high risk of damage of electronic components due to the radiative heat load received from the exhaust pipe of the engine. A design modification consisting of a radiative shield is proposed and model-tested, achieving an appropriate reduction of heat flux and temperatures, and thus an adequate protection of critical components.","1521-3323","","","10.1109/TADVP.2010.2074201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5594654","Electronic control unit;transient thermal network modeling;unsteady heat transfer","Engines;Heat transfer;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Transient analysis","automobile industry;automotive electronics;engines;heat transfer;numerical analysis","automobile;dynamic heat balance;electronic control unit;engine enclosure;heat flux reduction;heat transfer analysis;isothermal elements;lumped models;motorcar;multiscale systems;numerical simulations;radiative heat load;transient thermal network modelling","","","","2","","33","","2010-10-04","20110106","","IEEE","IEEE Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology Society;IEEE Photonics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed rail pressure model describes the relation between the common rail pressure and the driving current of the PCV as a quadratic function. This model is applied to the feedforward part of the PCV control algorithm. The MeUn control algorithm is designed to control the inlet fuel flow of the common rail. This algorithm is composed of a feedforward and feedback parts. The feedforward action is effective to reduce the rail pressure variation in a steady operating condition, and the feedback action reinforces the tracking performance of the rail pressure controller. In order to validate the proposed control algorithm, engine experiments were performed. The experiments include step change tests of the desired rail pressure and engine operating condition and the new European driving cycle test.

Thus, for this study, the authors have created “A-ACAM” (Automobile Exterior Color Design Approach Model) and the model's effectiveness has been verified. In creating the model, the authors utilized information from their own research, entitled “Kansei engineering in automobile”. They first determined the four elements most desired by young people when choosing exterior colors (classy, luxurious, dignified, and sporty). Next, they determined the six elements of color (hue, luminosity, intensity, shine, opacity, and graininess) that influence young buyers the most. Correspondence analysis was then applied with the aid of statistical science (multivariate analysis) in order to correlate the young people's preferences with the color elements, enabling the authors to determine the degree of influence of each of the color elements. Based on these findings, the model has subsequently been applied in exterior color development (paints and painting methods), demonstrating significant results.","","978-1-4244-7295-6","","10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668334","A-ACAM;automobile;exterior color;statistical science","Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Biological system modeling;Color;Image color analysis;Paints;Solids","automobile industry;automobiles;design engineering;statistical analysis","A-ACAM model;Kansei engineering;aesthetic factor;automobile exterior color design;car buying process;car exterior color;color elements;correspondence analysis;exterior color development;multivariate analysis;painting method;statistical science","","","","0","","11","","","20101213","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","7-10 Sept. 2009","2009","","","803","807","The high cost of fossil fuel and environmental concerns forced the automotive industry to seek innovative ways to improve gas mileage. The short term solution to these concerns is the concept of hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) that combines the use of an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor (EM). The energy of the battery used by a HEV can come from renewable sources such as solar and wind energy. It can also come from the energy recovered while decelerating the vehicle. The use of hybrid vehicles creates new control challenges in the area of energy management. The objective of this paper is to design and test a simple automatic control strategy to simplify the energy management problem of HEV. The main idea is to control the electric motor to provide the power needed to meet the minimum torque requirement, under no load condition and flat road, at different speed ranges of the vehicle. The remaining power will be provided by the ICE. The minimum torque and corresponding power will be determined using the vehicle model. Contrary to existing power management approaches, the proposed strategy does not require sophisticated optimization techniques nor use ad hoc rules that are difficult to tune. In addition, the proposed strategy is simple to implement as it requires only the knowledge of the vehicle speed and battery state of charge. The proposed control strategy was tested using a 2000 Honda Insight vehicle that was modeled using ADVISOR 2002 vehicle simulator. Preliminary simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can improve the gas mileage of the Honda Insight by as much as 50%.","","978-1-4244-2600-3","978-1-4244-2601-0","10.1109/VPPC.2009.5289767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5289767","Hybrid electric vehicles;Modeling and Simulation;Parameter Optimization;Power Based Control Strategy","Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Batteries;Costs;Electric motors;Energy management;Fossil fuels;Gas industry;Hybrid electric vehicles;Ice","automobile industry;hybrid electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;machine control","automotive industry;electric motor;energy management;hybrid electric vehicles;internal combustion engine;renewable sources","","","","1","","14","","","20091020","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a method for the exact parameter estimation of an impulse magnetizer and a method for field and thermal analysis of an impulse magnetizer using this parameter. As the detailed field and thermal characteristics of an impulse magnetizer can be obtained, the efficient design of an impulse magnetizer which produce desired magnet will be possible using this analysis procedure. As the parameter estimation method of impulse magnetizer, two different estimation methods (a method considering contact resistance and a method using air-core test coil) are presented. Also, the temperature computation of discharging circuits of an impulse magnetizer is very important since it gives some indication of the design of the magnetizing circuits. Therefore, a method for thermal analysis of impulse magnetizer is presented","","0-7803-7090-2","","10.1109/ISIE.2001.931849","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931849","","Capacitors;Circuit testing;Contact resistance;Fixtures;Impulse testing;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic circuits;Magnets;Parameter estimation;Shape","magnetic fields;magnetisation;magnets;parameter estimation;power capacitors;pulsed power supplies;temperature distribution;thermal analysis","air-core test coil;capacitor discharge impulse magnetizer;contact resistance;discharging circuit;exact parameter estimation;field modeling;high current impulse;impulse magnetizing fixture;magnet design;thermal modeling","","","","0","","","","","20020807","12 Jun 2001-16 Jun 2001","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This gap between algorithm exploration and implementation is being bridged by using graphical modeling tools such as Simulink®. Models implemented in Simulink® serve as Executable Specifications. They can be simulated to verify against requirements and be used as the basis for embedded code generation. The benefits of this approach have prompted many organizations to undertake fairly large effort to migrate their existing Legacy Embedded Software to Model Based Executable Specifications in order to reuse and to leverage their existing control know-how. This paper discusses some key aspects of this Translation Process that are important to ensure that the process is efficient and it results in a work product that is a “true representation” of the source code. The importance of a structured process, aids for model implementation, and, criteria to measure the resulting model quality are discussed in detail in this paper.","","0-7803-9797-5","0-7803-9797-5","10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776703","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Control system synthesis;Embedded computing;Embedded software;Software algorithms;Software measurement","","","","","","0","","13","","","20090206","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

During the mission, the UAVs seek to confirm and verifiably destroy suspected targets and discover, confirm, and verifiably destroy unknown targets. The locations of some (or all) targets are unknown a priori, requiring them to be located using cooperative search. In addition, the tasks to be performed at each target location by the team of cooperative UAVs need to be coordinated. The tasks must, therefore, be allocated to UAVs in real time as they arise, while ensuring that appropriate vehicles are assigned to each task. Each class of UAVs has its own sensing and attack capabilities, so the need for appropriate assignment is paramount. In this paper, an extensive dynamic model that captures the stochastic nature of the cooperative search and task assignment problems is developed, and algorithms for achieving a high level of performance are designed. The paper focuses on investigating the value of predictive task assignment as a function of the number of unknown targets and number of UAVs. In particular, it is shown that there is a tradeoff between search and task response in the context of prediction. Based on the results, a hybrid algorithm for switching the use of prediction is proposed, which balances the search and task response. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations.","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.861881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634650","Cooperative search;path planning;task allocation;unmanned aerial vehicle","Algorithm design and analysis;Automotive engineering;Computer science;Motion planning;Path planning;Robot motion;Robot sensing systems;Stochastic processes;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Vehicle dynamics","Monte Carlo methods;cooperative systems;remotely operated vehicles;search problems","Monte Carlo simulation;cooperative search;cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle teams;predictive task assignment;search response;task response","","","Aircraft;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cooperative Behavior;Cybernetics;Decision Support Techniques;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated","12","","80","","","20060605","","IEEE","IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A key component of the toolset is a reconfigurable engineering design simulator that can be used to model cockpit display concepts quickly and easily. This simulator uses Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS) technology to evaluate systems under consideration. This paper provides a detailed description of the engineering design simulator. It provides multiple-player (friend and foe) interactions with a simulated real-world environment. Players may be moving airborne or ground-based vehicles such as aircraft, tanks or armored personnel carriers; or may be static, such as surface-to-air-missile (SAM) site(s) or antiaircraft battery. The development and rapid prototyping of new cockpit configurations, as well as the simulation of existing cockpit configurations and aircraft are all possible with the engineering design simulator. This simulator ensures that the crew-centered development and validation of new cockpit configurations can be performed under realistic, adverse, and/or high workload conditions.

A fundamental issue is the derivation of the specific requirements for this interface, which is done based on knowledge of the typical user interaction with a car door and a comprehensive model of the dynamics of an actuated as well as an unactuated car door. The findings are that the device should only exhibit one rotatory degree-of-freedom, which should be actuated by a direct drive with a high torque output (ges 100 Nm) and very high position resolution (ges 16 Bit). A suitable direct-drive is selected and combined with other elements to form a backlash-free, very stiff haptic device. Due to both force and acceleration sensing, it can serve for the haptic rendering of actuated as well as unactuated car doors.

Proceedings of the 2002 International Conference on","2002","2002","2","","701","706 vol.2","The problem of estimating the exhaust manifold pressure in a turbocharged diesel engine is considered. The reciprocated engine causes the air-flow in the exhaust manifold to oscillate with a frequency that is a multiple of the engine speed. As a result of the oscillating airflow the pressure in the exhaust manifold will also oscillate. This oscillation makes it difficult and expensive to measure the pressure. Instead an observer for the exhaust manifold pressure is proposed. The observer is model-based, and the performance of the observer is evaluated by simulations.","","0-7803-7386-3","","10.1109/CCA.2002.1038686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038686","","Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Design automation;Diesel engines;Frequency;Legislation;Manifolds;Observers;Pressure measurement","automobile industry;internal combustion engines;observers","exhaust manifold pressure estimation;model-based observer;reciprocated engine;simulations;turbocharged diesel engine","","","","1","","","","","20021210","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper an approach is presented in which the computational complexity is significantly reduced by using scattering center models for the most complex objects. The scattering centers are described in form of directional, bistatic scattering intensities and can be computed for the isolated complex object in advance without considering the complete environment. Thus, the simulation performance benefit is due to a significant reduction of the complexity of the geometrical representation of the scene. The parameterization of the scattering centers itself is based on an efficient high frequency asymptotic field prediction tool incorporating Geometrical Optics and other techniques. The models are designed to study deterministically the wave propagation for vehicle based radar systems operating near 80 GHz. An example for a bistatic three-dimensional parameterization is given. Furthermore, a fast Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging technique is applied that can be used to find the most relevant scattering center positions on the objects.","","978-1-4244-4933-0","978-3-9812668-1-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5498262","","Automotive engineering;Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Frequency;Geometrical optics;Layout;Optical scattering;Radar scattering;Scattering parameters;Solid modeling","computational complexity;geometrical optics;radar imaging;road vehicle radar;synthetic aperture radar;wave propagation;wireless channels","asymptotic field prediction tool;automotive radar systems;bistatic scattering center model;bistatic three-dimensional parameterization;computational complexity;deterministic radio channel simulations;geometrical optics;geometrical representation;inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging technique;vehicle based radar systems;wave propagation simulation","","","","0","","14","","","20100701","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Realization of location-based services requires new technologies to provide appropriate neighborhood information to moving objects. A general approach to providing neighborhood information to moving objects is to retrieve objects in the neighborhood of a moving object with a spatial query that uses the traditional Euclidean distance. However, if we know the destination and the estimated route of a moving object, we would be able to provide more appropriate information to the object. Based on this idea, we have developed adaptive spatial query generation models that take the trajectory of a moving object into consideration to retrieve desired information. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the neighborhood information retrieval system based on the models and evaluate its effectiveness with experiments.","","0-7695-2103-7","","10.1109/WISEW.2003.1286783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286783","","Appropriate technology;Automotive engineering;Ellipsoids;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Navigation;Prototypes;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","information retrieval systems;mobile computing;query processing;search problems;transforms","Euclidean distance;adaptive neighborhood information retrieval system;adaptive spatial query generation model;digital cartography;global positioning systems;location-based services;mobile devices;mobile users","","","","0","","","","","20040419","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without appropriate preconditions, the integration of mixed-criticality subsystems can lead to a significant and potentially unacceptable increase of engineering and certification costs. A promising solution is to incorporate mechanisms that establish multiple partitions with strict temporal and spatial separation between the individual partitions. In this approach, subsystems with different levels of criticality can be placed in different partitions and can be verified and validated in isolation. The MultiPARTES FP7 project aims at supporting mixed-criticality integration for embedded systems based on virtualization techniques for heterogeneous multicore processors. A major outcome of the project is the MultiPARTES XtratuM, an open source hyper visor designed as a generic virtualization layer for heterogeneous multicore. MultiPARTES evaluates the developed technology through selected use cases from the offshore wind power, space, visual surveillance, and automotive domains. The impact of MultiPARTES on the targeted domains will be also discussed. In a number of ongoing research initiatives (e.g., RECOMP, ARAMIS, MultiPARTES, CERTAINTY) mixed-criticality integration is considered in multicore processors. Key challenges are the combination of software virtualization and hardware segregation and the extension of partitioning mechanisms to jointly address significant non-functional requirements (e.g., time, energy and power budgets, adaptivity, reliability, safety, security, volume, weight, etc.) along with development and certification methodology.","","","","10.1109/DSD.2013.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6628285","dependability;hypervisor;mixed-criticality;model-driven engineering","Certification;Hardware;Multicore processing;Operating systems;Program processors;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","embedded systems;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;multiprocessing systems;public domain software;safety-critical software;virtual machines;virtualisation","MultiPARTES FP7 project;MultiPARTES XtratuM;embedded systems;functional multitude integration;hardware segregation;heterogeneous multicore processor;mixed criticality subsystems integration;multicore virtualization;nonfunctional requirement;open source hypervisor design;partitioning mechanism;software virtualization;spatial partition separation;temporal partition separation","","","","0","","","","","20131015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the estimation of the vehicle side slip angle and velocity, a SM observer based on the hierarchical super twisting algorithm is proposed permitting to reduce the error and to increase the precision. Validations with the simulator VE-DYNA pointed out the good performance and the robustness of the proposed observers. After the validation of these observers, a braking controller based on a reduced model for the vehicle centre of gravity in the (X, Y) plane is developed. The design of this controller is based on the sliding mode techniques and it is supposed to work only in the emergency cases (and after the convergence of the observers).

However, the computational burden of implementing an extended Kalman filter is significant. Moreover, some parameters needed to make the extended Kalman filter function correctly are difficult to estimate from measured data. This paper proposes an SoC estimator design using linear parameter varying (LPV) system techniques that provides a low computational alternative to the extended Kalman filter. The stability of this estimator can be verified analytically.

The dominant elements in a model for concurrent engineering processes are the informational relations and flows between the different processes. These build the basis for an information-based engineering process.

CAIDCD '06. 7th International Conference on","17-19 Nov. 2006","2006","","","1","4","In solving the decision-making problems of complex multi-index evaluating scheme, the traditional way is to adopt fuzzy unified evaluating method. But the traditional fuzzy evaluating method has a lot of shortcomings, e.g. being unable to fully reflect the intended purpose of fuzzy evaluation, because it is difficult for experts to score an evaluating index definitely; sometimes hardly providing a definite dependence-degree for index evaluation; and sometimes causing a considerable amount of information to be ""flooded"" in the decision-making process when the decision-making system is rather complicated and there are too many factors to be taken into account, thus each getting only a little factor in the distribution, and even leading to failure of the model. Besides, compared with the factor-dependence-degree-based fuzzy evaluating matrix which takes into consideration only the separate influences of every single influencing factor, the complex scheme is a unified whole, in which all influencing factors cooperatively impose their influence on system attributes, i.e. a typical gray information which should be made full use of in the decision-making process. In view of the shortcomings of traditional fuzzy unified evaluating method, i.e. rough evaluation of indexes and negligence of holistic information in the evaluating process, this thesis proposes a vague set-based index-evaluating method. The multi-attribute fuzzy decision, by introducing gray system theory into the scheme, forms a fuzzy decision-making model based on gray relational analysis. The effectiveness of this method is proved with an example","","1-4244-0683-8","1-4244-0684-6","10.1109/CAIDCD.2006.329452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4127039","","Automotive engineering;Decision making;Electronic mail;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems","decision making;decision theory;fuzzy set theory;grey systems;matrix algebra","complex multiindex evaluating scheme;factor-dependence-degree-based fuzzy evaluating matrix;grey fuzzy decision-making method;vague set","","","","1","","8","","","20070326","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To optimize the performance of vehicle localization systems, localization algorithms that analyze multi-sensor data processed using a Kalman filter have been developed. However, a Kalman filter with a single process model cannot guarantee the accuracy of localization under various driving conditions, because the single vehicle model does not cover all driving situations. Therefore, we present a position estimation algorithm based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter that uses two kinds of vehicle models: a kinematic vehicle model and a dynamic vehicle model. While the kinematic vehicle model is suitable for low-speed and low-slip driving conditions, the dynamic vehicle model is more appropriate for high-speed and high-slip situations. The IMM filter integrates the estimates from a kinematic vehicle model based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and estimates from a dynamic vehicle model based on EKF to improve localization accuracy. The developed estimation algorithm was verified by simulation using a commercial vehicle model. The simulation results show that the estimates of vehicle position by the algorithm presented in this study are accurate under a wide range of driving conditions.","1931-0587","978-1-4244-7866-8","","10.1109/IVS.2010.5548118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548118","","Algorithm design and analysis;Collision avoidance;Data analysis;Filters;Intelligent systems;Intelligent vehicles;Kinematics;Performance analysis;Vehicle driving;Vehicle dynamics","Global Positioning System;Kalman filters;navigation;radio receivers;sensor fusion;traffic information systems;vehicle dynamics","GPS receivers;IMM filter;dynamic vehicle model;extended Kalman filter;global positioning system;inertial navigation systems;intelligent transformation systems;interacting multiple model filter;kinematic vehicle model;low slip driving;low speed driving;multisensor data;position estimation algorithm;vehicle localization system","","","","4","","20","","","20100816","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The VSG has been extensively tested in automotive trials in Europe and the Far East, the results of which have been published. The VSG has proved to be reliable and robust. Micropulse was developed as a continuation of the Vibrating Structure family of products. The aim was to design a product that would improve the performance over temperature whilst retaining the inherent high levels of reliability and robustness. Micropulse extends the range of solid state sensors which BASE produces. The VSG senses rate using a piezo-electric ceramic shell which is excited into a cos (2Θ) vibration pattern. The direction of vibration pattern lags behind the shell when the shell is rotated. This enables rotation to be sensed. The electronics excites the shell into resonance, stabilises the vibration pattern direction with respect to the shell, and outputs a DC signal proportional to rotation rate. Both the Micropulse gyroscope and the VSG in senses rotation through the use of a resonating shell type structure. The improvements in performance arise through the replacement of the ceramic cup with another structure. The paper will outline the basic principles of rotation sensing using resonating structures and their design. It will also consider the applications for which this new product is intended, and will also present data which illustrates the potential of the instrument","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=369859","","","angular measurement;electric sensing devices;gyroscopes;piezoceramics;piezoelectric transducers;vibrations","BASE;Micropulse;Vibrating Sensor;automotive trials;piezo-electric ceramic shell;resonance;solid state rotation sensors;vibrating gyroscopes","","","","0","","","","","20020806","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

An Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for vehicle climate control is used in this case study. The ECU model in Simulink is imported as a model in MoDAL with SDF defined as the MoC, and the model is then interpreted to a MoML file for Ptolemy II to perform code generation. The case study shows the potential of SDF-based code generation to be used in the development process of embedded systems.","","978-1-4577-0980-7","978-0-7695-4459-5","10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032240","Code Generation;Electronic Control Unit;Embedded Systems;Synchronous Dataflow","Computational modeling;Heat engines;Heating;Mathematical model;Meteorology;Schedules","automobile industry;automotive electronics;control engineering computing;data flow computing;embedded systems;program compilers;software engineering;temperature control","MoDAL;MoML file;Ptolemy II;Simulink;code generation;code generator;compiling stage;control system and;deadlock avoidance;electronic control unit software development;embedded system design;memory usage;model of computation;model-based design;signal processing modeling;synchronous dataflow;vehicle climate control","","","","0","","17","","","20111003","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '08","10-14 March 2008","2008","","","556","561","In this paper, we propose a simulation-based methodology for worst-case response time estimation of distributed real-time systems. Schedulability analysis produces pessimistic upper bounds on process response times. Consequently, such an analysis can lead to overdesigned systems resulting in unnecessarily increased costs. Simulations, if well conducted, can lead to tight lower bounds on worst-case response times, which can be an essential input at design time. Moreover, such a simulation methodology is very important in situations when the running application or the underlying platform is such that no formal timing analysis is available. Another important application of the proposed simulation environment is the validation of formal analysis approaches, by estimating their degree of pessimism. We have performed such an estimation of pessimism for two response-time analysis approaches for distributed embedded systems based on two of the most important automotive communication protocols: CAN and FlexRay.","","978-3-9810801-3-1","978-3-9810801-4-8","10.1109/DATE.2008.4484735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4484735","","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Costs;Delay;Embedded system;Performance analysis;Protocols;Real time systems;Timing;Upper bound","distributed processing","automotive communication protocols;distributed embedded systems;distributed real-time systems;process response times;response- time analysis;schedulability analysis;worst-case response time estimation","","","","2","","14","","","20080411","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particular reference is made to the stability of the rectified DC link voltage under load disturbance and potentially inaccurate system models. In the system under consideration, the primary power source is a 4-cylinder normally aspirated gasoline internal combustion engine, which is mechanically coupled to a three-phase permanent magnet AC generator. The generated AC voltage is subsequently rectified to supply a lead-acid battery, and permanent magnet traction motors via three-phase full bridge power electronic inverters. Two complementary performance objectives exist. Firstly to maintain the internal combustion engine at its optimal operating point, and secondly to supply a stable 42 V supply to the traction drive inverters. Achievement of these goals minimises the transient energy storage requirements at the DC link, with a consequent reduction in both weight and cost. These objectives imply constant velocity operation of the internal combustion engine under external load disturbances and changes in both operating conditions and vehicle speed set-points. An electronically operated throttle allows closed loop engine velocity control. System time-delays and non-linearities render closed loop control design extremely problematic. A model based controller is designed and shown to be robust in controlling the DC link voltage, resulting in well-conditioned operation of the hybrid vehicle.","1553-572X","1-4244-0783-4","","10.1109/IECON.2007.4460011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4460011","Automotive;Hybrid Vehicles;Model-Reference Control;Time-Delay","AC generators;Batteries;Hybrid electric vehicles;Internal combustion engines;Inverters;Power system modeling;Robust control;Stability;Velocity control;Voltage control","angular velocity control;closed loop systems;delays;hybrid electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;invertors;permanent magnet generators;rectifying circuits;traction motor drives","closed loop engine velocity control;generator voltage stabilisation;internal combustion engine;lead-acid battery;load disturbance;permanent magnet traction motors;rectified DC link voltage;series-hybrid vehicle;speed control;system nonlinearities;three-phase permanent magnet AC generator;time-delays;transient energy storage","","","","1","","18","","","20080303","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a recurrent-cerebellar-model-articulation-controller (RCMAC)-based control system for the car-following control of a platoon of automated vehicles. In this control system, an RCMAC is the main controller that is used to mimic a perfect control law, and a compensation controller is designed to compensate for the difference between the perfect control law and the RCMAC. The online adaptive laws of the control system are derived from the Lyapunov stability theorem so that the stability of the system can be guaranteed.

This inverter is designed for variable inductive loads and low output power applications. We proposed a novel simple PWM method which enables the inverter to keep the output current at six times more than the rated output current, without reducing output voltage value. In addition, based on a simple use of resonance in the circuit, the new inverter can raise the output voltage to extremely high amplitude for a relatively short time. These characteristics make the proposed inverter is useful for some industrial applications such as electrical vehicle. The new configuration of the circuit consists of a unidirectional switch, two inductors (to transfer energy), a fast diode and a capacitor. With very few elements, this system changes the input DC voltage to a desired sinusoidal AC voltage. Some advantages of this system are: number of power electronics devices is low - it only uses a simple switch; it does not need dead time, in spite of conventional inverters which need a dead time between switches to prevent from short-circuiting; volume of the circuit is very small; the total harmonic distortion (THD) is greatly reduced; and it works with high efficiency. Another advantage of this inverter is capability of the circuit in boosting or bucking the input voltage to a desirable output voltage without using any DC-DC converters. It is flexible in keeping output voltage constant when the output current is increased, and it can produce the extremely higher output voltage than input voltage. The main drawback of the method, compared with conventional voltage source inverters, is that it uses more energy storage elements in spite of its low volume of power. We used simulations to prove all these statements.","","978-1-4673-5017-4","","10.1109/PECon.2012.6450280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450280","DC-AC converter;SPWM inverter;inverter;minimizing component;single switch inverter;vehicular applications","Abstracts;Conferences;Integrated circuits;Inverters;Logic gates;Pulse width modulation;TV","DC-DC power convertors;PWM invertors;automotive electrics;electric vehicles;harmonic distortion;power electronics;switching convertors","DC-DC converters;PWM inverter;THD;electrical vehicle;energy storage elements;low power vehicular application;resonance inverter;short-circuit;total harmonic distortion;unidirectional switch;voltage source inverters","","","","0","","16","","","20130207","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since digital and real mock-up must match for the further product development, the transfer of differences between physical and digital mock-up to the CAD format is a crucial issue. In this paper an augmented reality (AR) based tool-chain is presented, which allows matching the CAD data with real mock-ups and documents the differences between them.

For large, real-world designs, however, it is not always clear, whether or not a certain context violates even the most basic design assumptions of employed library components, thus often leading to expensive runtime errors. This paper introduces a practical method for checking compatibility of large designs, statically. This method not only ensures that large component-based designs provide a context such that all (library) components have well defined types, but it also ensures that transmitted physical units, such as m2, km/h, mph, etc. are preserved during computation. As such the possibility for runtime errors is reduced, and a metric for sound component reuse given.","1089-6503","978-0-7695-2977-6","","10.1109/EUROMICRO.2007.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4301070","","Australia;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Inference algorithms;Libraries;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Measurement units;Runtime","object-oriented programming;reasoning about programs;software libraries;software reusability","component libraries;component-based system compatibility;component-based system reuse;type inference;unit inference","","","","2","","14","","","20070917","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In model A, all agents have two observations at each step: a common observation that all agents observe and a private observation of their own. The control actions of each agent is based on all past common observations, the current private observation and the contents of its memory. At each step, each agent also updates the contents of its memory. A cost function, which depends on the state of the plant and the control actions of all agents, is given. The objective is to choose control and memory update functions for all agents to either minimize a total expected cost over a finite horizon or to minimize a discounted cost over an infinite horizon. In model B, the agents do not have any common observation, the rest is same as in model A. The key idea of our solution methodology is the following. From the point of view of a fictitious agent that observes all common observations, the system can be viewed as a centralized system with partial observations. This allows us to identify information states and obtain a sequential decomposition. When the system variables take values in finite sets, the optimality equations of the sequential decomposition are similar to those of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) with finite state and action spaces. For such systems, we can use algorithms for POMDPs to compute optimal designs for models A and B.","","978-1-4244-2925-7","978-1-4244-2926-4","10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797732","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automotive engineering;Cost function;Distributed control;Equations;Infinite horizon;Sensor systems;Surveillance;Telecommunication computing;Unmanned aerial vehicles","Markov processes;decentralised control;identification","finite horizon;finite sets;partially observable Markov decision processes;sequential decomposition;tractable decentralized control problems","","","","9","","17","","","20090304","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Supercomputer design is challenging, but this problem is harder due to the huge range of possible configurations, volatile component availability and pricing, and constraints on available power, cooling, and floor space. Cluster design rules (CDR) is a computer-aided engineering tool that uses resource constraints and application performance models to identify the few best designs among the trillions of designs that could be constructed using parts from a given database. It uses a branch-and-bound strategy based on cluster design principles that can eliminate many inferior designs from the search without evaluating them. For the millions of designs that remain, CDR measures fitness by one of several user-specified application performance models. New application performance models can be added by means of a programming interface. This paper details the concepts and mechanisms inside CDR and shows how it facilitates model-based engineering of custom clusters.","","978-1-4244-2232-6","978-1-4244-2233-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510737","","Aerospace engineering;Application software;Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Computer aided engineering;Design engineering;Drugs;Predictive models;Supercomputers;Weather forecasting","application program interfaces;computer aided engineering;mainframes;parallel machines;workstation clusters","cluster design rules;cluster supercomputers;computer aided engineering;programming interface;resource constraints","","","","0","","38","","","20080507","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the analysis of the system architecture, the dynamic model of the air system is developed, in which a semi-empirical model of blower is built and the impact of parasitic power of the blower on the net power of the fuel cell system is taken into consideration. The accuracy of the model is verified by comparing the simulation results with the experimental data. Then the reason for instability is studied using both model simulation and theoretical analysis which employs the automatic control theory based on the linearized system model. The analysis result shows that the feedback loop of the blower current is the cause for instability. Furthermore, a new control algorithm is designed. The new control algorithm opens the current loop and adapts the optimized control parameters.

Nevertheless, such systems must be acceptable for drivers and must have a good reliability both in terms of roadsides recognition and of vehicle location estimation. Such a system must therefore be able to run in spite of difficult situations (due to occlusions, traffic, bad weather conditions, etc). Furthermore, the accuracy of the 3D vehicle estimation must be sufficient in order to feed subsequent warning systems. The system we have designed is able to recognize with reliability the lane sides in the current image and uses a 3D/4D modelling which provides both a good recognition as well as a very accurate 3D parameters estimation (vehicle location, steer angle, road curvatures, etc). The paper focuses mainly on this 3D original estimation stage and presents our recent developments (distance between vehicle and each road side for lane tracking application, analysis distances increasing, vertical road curvature estimation).

The selection of an appropriate control structure is crucial, since it determines the complexity of the control design and parameter tuning process. This paper presents a flexible model-free control structure based on physical insights in the car and semi-active suspension dynamics which are used to linearize and decouple the system. A static decoupling is used to decouple the system into its modal motions heave, roll and pitch, which are then controlled by modal (diagonal) controllers, consisting of several feedback and feedforward modules, each taking care of a specific comfort or handling issue. The feedback controller is based on the Skyhook principle. Steering angle, throttle, and break pedal feedforward control roll during cornering, and pitch during acceleration and deceleration, respectively.

Proceedings. 2004 IEEE","6-13 March 2004","2004","5","","3495","3501 Vol.5","We can expect to see an increase in the deployment of unmanned air and land vehicles for autonomous exploration of space. In order to maintain autonomous control of such systems, it is essential to track the current state of the system. When the system includes safety-critical components, failures or faults in the system must be diagnosed as quickly as possible, and their effects compensated for so that control and safety are maintained under a variety of fault conditions. The Livingstone fault diagnosis and recovery kernel and its temporal extension L2 are examples of model-based reasoning engines for health management. Livingstone has been shown to be effective, it is in demand, and it is being further developed. It was part of the successful remote agent demonstration on Deep Space One in 1999. It has been and is being utilized by several projects involving groups from various NASA centers, including the In Situ Propellant Production (ISPP) simulation at Kennedy Space Center, the X-34 and X-37 experimental reusable launch vehicle missions, Techsat-21, and advanced life support projects. Model-based and consistency-based diagnostic systems like Livingstone work only with discrete and finite domain models. When quantitative and continuous behaviors are involved, these are abstracted to discrete form using some mapping. This mapping from the quantitative domain to the qualitative domain is sometimes very involved and requires the design of highly sophisticated and complex monitors. We propose a diagnostic methodology that deals directly with quantitative models and behaviors, thereby mitigating the need for these sophisticated mappings. Our work brings together ideas from model-based diagnosis systems like Livingstone and concurrent constraint programming concepts. The system uses explanations derived from the propagation of quantitative constraints to generate conflicts. Fast conflict generation algorithms are used to generate and maintain multiple candidates whose consistency can be tracked across multiple time steps.","1095-323X","0-7803-8155-6","","10.1109/AERO.2004.1368155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1368155","","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Fault diagnosis;Inference mechanisms;Kernel;Land vehicles;Maintenance engineering;Safety;Space exploration;Systems engineering and theory","aerospace computing;aerospace control;constraint handling;fault diagnosis;model-based reasoning;remotely operated vehicles;space research","Deep Space One;In Situ Propellant Production;Kennedy Space Center;Livingstone fault diagnosis;NASA centers;Techsat-21;X-34 launch vehicle;X-37 launch vehicle;advanced life support projects;autonomous control;autonomous exploration;complex monitors;concurrent constraint programming;conflict generation algorithms;consistency-based diagnostic systems;continuous behaviors;discrete domain models;engineered systems;experimental launch vehicle;explanation constraint programming;fault conditions;fault recovery kernel;finite domain models;health management;land vehicles;model-based diagnosis;model-based diagnostic systems;model-based reasoning engines;quantitative behaviors;quantitative models;reusable launch vehicle missions;safety-critical components;sophisticated mapping;sophisticated monitors;space exploration;system failure;unmanned air vehicles","","","","1","","9","","","20041220","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To use the air spring actuator in a superimposed vibration control, a force controller was designed, based on a linearized air spring model. Using four force-controlled air springs in the suspension of a cabin, a superimposed vibration control can be designed, which reduces the cabin accelerations in the lifting, pitching and rolling degree of freedom.

A model of the driver's nominal behavior is estimated based on his observed behavior. The driver commands the vehicle, whereas the safety system corrects the driver's steering and braking actions in case there is a risk that the vehicle will unintentionally depart from the road.

Through the analysis of the simulation results, it was found that the influence is discrepant under different overlap ratio in oblique crash. The KW400 influences compatibility much more than the AHOF400 does. Furthermore, a better way to evaluate geometry characteristic in oblique collisions should be established to help improving compatibility in this crash configuration.","","978-1-4673-5652-7","","10.1109/ICMTMA.2013.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6493807","AHOF400;KW400;crash compatibility;front structure;oblique crash","","automobiles;automotive components;finite element analysis;impact (mechanical);vehicle dynamics","AHOF400;FEM;KW400;SUV;Sedan;average height of force 400;car front structure characteristics;crush-work stiffness;oblique collisions;vehicle oblique crash","","","","0","","10","","","20130404","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm integrates three types of road-slope measurements from a GPS receiver, automotive onboard sensors, and a longitudinal vehicle model. The measurement integration is achieved through a probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) that combines multiple measurements into a single measurement update by assigning statistical probability to each measurement and by removing faulty measurement via the false-alarm function of the PDAF. In addition to the PDAF, an interacting multiple-model filter (IMMF) approach is applied to the slope estimation algorithm to allow adaptation to various slope conditions. The model set of the IMMF is composed of a constant-slope road model (CSRM) and a constant-rate slope road model (CRSRM). The CSRM assumes that the slope of the road is always constant, and the CRSRM assumes that the slope of the road changes at a constant rate. The IMMF adapts the road-slope model to the driving conditions. The developed algorithm is verified and evaluated through experimental and case studies using a real-time embedded system. The results show that the performance and efficiency of the road-slope estimation algorithm is accurate and reliable enough for intelligent vehicle applications.","1524-9050","","","10.1109/TITS.2013.2266438","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6545331","Interacting multiple-model probabilistic data association (IMMPDA) filter;multiple road models;road-slope estimation;sensor fusion","Algorithm design and analysis;Filters;Global Positioning System;Sensor fusion;Sensors","Global Positioning System;automated highways;probability;road vehicles;sensor fusion","GPS receiver;IMMF approach;IMMPDA filter;automotive onboard sensor;constant rate slope road model;constant slope road model;false alarm function;intelligent vehicle;interacting multiple model filter;interacting multiple-model probabilistic data association filter;longitudinal vehicle model;real time embedded system;road slope estimation algorithm;road slope measurement;statistical probability","","","","0","","27","","2013-06-21","20131125","","IEEE","IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A SISO feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN) model is developed using input-output data sets obtained from the mathematical model simulation. Levenberg-Marquandt algorithm was employed in training the NN model. The NNMPC was used to predict the future responses that are optimized in a subloop of the plant for cost minimization. The proposed controller is compared with an optimally tuned constant-gain PID controller (based on Ziegler-Nichols tuning method) during suspension travel setpoint tracking in the presence of deterministic road input disturbance.

The group of piston crankshaft connecting rod is designed and each part is modeled in Pro/E. Pro/E is a solid modeler and this offers considerable advantage for solid model creation. Normally, the geometry is first sketched in 2-D and then extruded in the third direction to generate a 3-D model. In Pro/E, it is important to first create the base geometry. The base geometry is that geometry that captures the design intent of the part to be modeled. This base geometry can be created using either the EXTRUDE or the REVOLVE options. Once this base geometry has been created, additional features like holes, rounds, chamfers, fillets, ribs, etc can be added in the finishing stages of the part creation. The center of the bowl does not coincide with the center of the cylinder due to the presence of valve pockets. The obvious advantage of this configuration is that is gives the true geometry of the piston and the presence of connecting rod means that the connecting rod ports can be accommodated when the piston is at the top dead center. In addition to the crankshaft with connecting rod, fly gear will also be added. Various instances of this configuration will then be created using the Â¿Family TableÂ¿ option of Pro/E wildfire in an attempt to optimize the engine performance. The presence of the connecting rod will make the mesh creation process more challenging for the modeler. This means that the numerical computation will be more intensive.","","978-1-4244-5001-5","978-1-4244-5739-7","10.1109/ICMTMA.2010.805","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460126","3-D design;PRO/E","Automotive engineering;Civil engineering;Design automation;Design engineering;Geometry;Joining processes;Mechatronics;Pistons;Product design;Solid modeling","gears;mesh generation;pistons;product design;rotation;shafts","3-D Design;Pro/E wildfire;base geometry;engine performance;extrude options;family table option;fly gear;mesh creation process;piston crankshaft connecting rod;revolve options;top-down method;valve pockets","","","","1","","6","","","20100506","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The upstream controller provides relatively rapid response to disturbances on the basis of measured feedgas A/F ratio, while the downstream controller uses the feedgas and post-catalyst A/F ratio measurements to compensate for the bias corrupting the feedgas A/F ratio measurement. The performance and robustness of the proposed control system in the face of noise and model uncertainty are first evaluated through extensive simulations.

The second algorithm, which constitutes the main contribution, is suitable for large problems and provides an approximate solution by means of a greedy heuristic and by relaxing the minimal cardinality requirement. The foundation for the algorithms is a novel formulation of the selection problem which enables an efficient reduction of the search-space by taking into account realizability properties, with respect to the considered residual generation method.

This paper aims to address both these issues based on modeling and simulation tests performed on an average sport utility vehicle (SUV) model, configured as a parallel HEV with an on-board ISA. The characteristics of suitable AC induction motors and permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSM), in addition to varying parallel ISA based HEV drive train control strategies, will be examined.

The conceptual model on which MCSE is based considers 2 views for a system: the functional model allows designers to describe their solutions in an application-oriented view of the system, the executive model depicts the hardware components or necessary resources, and interconnections between them. CoDesign is shown as an enhancement of the implementation specification step of MCSE. One main problem is then system partitioning for which we propose an interactive procedure based on performance and cost evaluations. The software part of the solution is generated from the functional description level. The hardware part is synthesized from a VHDL behavioral description which is also generated from the subset of the functional description allocated to the hardware. The links between hardware and software are also synthesized. Such a procedure and associated tools lead to efficiently obtain system prototypes in an incremental manner. An example is given to illustrate the benefit of the proposed method, the significance of the functional level and the specific part of a system development for which CoDesign is appropriate","","0-8186-6430-4","","10.1109/EURMIC.1994.390411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=390411","","Automotive engineering;Costs;Embedded system;Hardware;Process design;Real time systems;Software performance;Software tools;Time to market;Very large scale integration","circuit CAD;formal specification;hardware description languages;real-time systems","CoDesign;MCSE methodology;VHDL behavioral description;conceptual model;cost evaluation;functional description level;hardware components;implementation specification;interactive procedure;interconnections;performance evaluation;system design process;system partitioning","","","","1","","13","","","20020806","05 Sep 1994-08 Sep 1994","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A model taken from the literature is used to simulate the dynamic of a kite which can be controlled by suitably pulling two lines. Energy is generated by a cycle composed of two phases, indicated as the traction and the recovery one. The control unit has two electric drives which act as motors in pulling the lines for controlling the flight or for recovering the kite and as generators if the kite pulls the lines. In each phase, control is obtained by ""fast"" implementations of suitable NMPC designs. In the traction phase the control is designed such that the kite pulls the lines, maximizing the amount of generated energy. When the maximal length of the lines is reached, the control enters the recovery phase and the kite is driven to a region where the lines can be pulled by the motors until the minimal length is reached, spending a small fraction of the energy generated in the traction phase, and a new traction phase is undertaken.

The welding current waveforms simulated based on the mathematical model are consistent with those captured in welding experiments, which proves that the mathematical model is correct. The signal features are analyzed as arc rotating frequency, radius and torch deviation from V-groove centre varied. The results show that the deviation of the welding torch is in proportion with the asymmetry of the current waveform in corresponding arc rotational cycle.

No matter how good a battery is, a failure can always occur in a battery leading to serious inconvenience, performance deterioration and costly replacement. Thus, it is desirable to be able to detect the underlying degradation and to predict level of unsatisfactory performance. By using current, voltage and temperature measurements of Ni-MH batteries, they can be modeled so that the internal dynamics of the batteries can be estimated and state of health of the batteries can be predicted for secure and long-life operations. An observer-based fault diagnosis approach is designed to analyze the state of health of the Ni-MH battery system of HEVs in this study. Real-world input data is used to assess the efficiency of the approach in the existence of uncertainties.

Instead of operating simplifications on the system geometry, an analytical model-order reduction procedure is applied to characterize the dynamics of the air path system starting from the fundamental conservation laws, namely the nonlinear Euler equations for unsteady compressible flows. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied to the characterization of the intake and exhaust flows in the manifolds of a single-cylinder engine.

In this paper, we analyze structural models of a modern realistic automotive vehicle system with the aim to assess the extent and characteristics of interactions between system functions. Our results show that at least 69% of the analyzed system functions depend on each other or influence each other. These dependencies stretch all over the system whereby single system functions have dependencies to up to 40% of all system functions.

An auxiliary power source (APS) can be used in the vehicle to alleviate this performance limitation. This paper explores the tradeoff between vehicle performance and energy capacity of the APS system for several battery technologies and reformer lags using model-based simulation. It is shown that for a given vehicle, motor and fuel cell system configuration, there is an optimal choice for the APS energy capacity for different APS (battery) technologies. Based on unit costs associated with the battery technologies, the analysis is extended to include cost factors in the APS system selection process.

A 3-bit DMTL phase shifter, fabricated on a glass substrate using MEMS switches and coplanar-waveguide lines, results in an average loss of 2.7 dB at 78 GHz (0.9 dB/bit). The measured figure-of-merit performance is 93°/dB-100°/dB (equivalent to 0.9 dB/bit) of loss at 75-110 GHz. The associated phase error is ±3° (rms phase error is 1.56°) and the reflection loss is below -10 dB over all eight states. A 2-bit phase shifter is also demonstrated with comparable performance to the 3-bit design. It is seen that the phase shifter can be accurately modeled using a combination of full-wave electromagnetic and microwave circuit analysis, thereby making the design quite easy up to 110 GHz. These results represent the best phase-shifter performance to date using any technology at W-band frequencies. Careful analysis indicates that the 75-110-GHz figure-of-merit performance becomes 150°/dB-200°/dB, and the 3-bit average insertion loss improves to 1.8-2.1 dB if the phase shifter is fabricated on quartz substrates.","0018-9480","","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.821941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266886","","Electromagnetic modeling;Electromagnetic reflection;Glass;Loss measurement;Micromechanical devices;Microswitches;Performance loss;Phase shifters;Radio frequency;Transmission lines","coplanar waveguide components;equivalent circuits;microswitches;millimetre wave phase shifters","75 to 110 GHz;MEMS phase shifters;MEMS switches;W-band phase shifters;automotive radar;coplanar-waveguide lines;distributed phase shifters;figure-of-merit performance;glass substrate;lumped model;microelectromechanical transmission-line concept;millimeter-wave phase shifter;true-time delay","","","","39","","12","","","20040219","","IEEE","IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Tomorrows electronic car systems provide enhanced functionality, are networked and interact with each other and external services. Designing such systems requires a powerful way to structure, describe and reuse the components of the car and the surrounding environment","","0-7803-5086-3","","10.1109/DASC.1998.739863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=739863","","Automata;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Communication system security;Communications technology;Driver circuits;Electronic components;Hardware;Information security;Manufacturing","automotive electronics","automotive system design;electronic based systems;entertainment;functionality;model-based specification;security;structured analysis process","","","","1","","7","","","20020806","31 Oct 1998-07 Nov 1998","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern cars have up to 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that implement a variety of control applications in a distributed fashion. The tasks are mapped onto different ECUs, communicating via a heterogeneous network, comprising communication buses like CAN, FlexRay, and Ethernet. For electric vehicles, software functions play an essential role, replacing hydraulic and mechanic control systems. While model-based software development and verification are already used extensively in the automotive domain, their importance significantly increases in electric vehicles as safety-critical functions might no longer rely on mechanical (fall-back) solutions. The need for reducing costs, size, and weight in electric vehicles has also resulted in a considerable interest in topics such as the consolidation of ECUs as well as efficient implementation of control software. In this paper we discuss two broad issues related to model-based software development and verification in electric vehicles. The first is concerned with how to ensure that model-level semantics are preserved in an implementation, which has important implications on the verification and certification of control software. The second issue is related to techniques for reducing the computational and communication demands of distributed automotive control algorithms. For both these topics we provide a broad introduction to the problem followed by a discussion on state-of-the-art techniques.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560689","Electric vehicles;control systems;control/architecture co-design;model-based design","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Delays;Electric vehicles;Schedules;Sensors;Software","automobiles;control engineering computing;distributed control;electric vehicles;program verification;safety-critical software","CAN;ECU;Ethernet;FlexRay;automotive domain;cars;communication buses;control software certification;distributed automotive control algorithms;electric vehicles;electronic control units;model-based development;model-based verification;model-level semantics;safety-critical functions","","","","0","","","","","20130718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The developed system consists of a rule-base, a design process control module and a geometric modeler (CATIA). The rule-base includes design rules and know-how of design specialists and CATIA is used to provide CAD environment. The rule-base and the design control modules are developed with C++ language as an interface to CATIA.

These systems are supposed to suppress the airbag if a child or an infant is occupying the front passenger seat. We are investigating the use of machine vision to classify front-seat passenger occupants into four classes: (i) adult, (ii) empty, (iii) RFIS (rear facing infant seat), and child. The design and integration of such a vision system into automobiles is very difficult due to (i) occupant variability (e.g., different types of infant seats and children clothing), and (ii) extreme lighting variability (e.g., bright sunny days, and night time operation).

This paper contributes to the analysis of the functions-architecture interaction impact on the diagnosability of an embedded system, especially automotive systems. The approach we developed can be integrated into the design cycle. It has two important phases; first, the diagnosability analysis of discrete event systems, then the verification of a property set that we have defined and called the “diagnosability functional-architectural properties”. Properties verification is done in two stages: check the description of the architecture, described in AADL, and check the functions-architecture interaction, modeled in SystemC-Simulink.

Different layouts of a three chip, laminate MCM were performed with and without EMI driven routing constraints. Quantic Labs EMC software was then used to simulate the crosstalk on critical nets for the different routings. It is shown that proper routing constraints can greatly reduce noise on susceptible nets and reduce noise on all nets in general. A software package to automatically generate router constraints base on EMI considerations is being developed to simplify the routing process. For experimental validation of the Quantic software, simple test structures were fabricated, tested and compared to simulation predictions. Also, a comparison of the coupled noise on the motherboard with an MCM versus three individual surface mount packages shows that the MCM significantly reduces the conducted emissions at the system level. Effective design of automotive MCM's with proper consideration to EMI requirements can substantially reduce conducted emissions from an engine controller unit onto the wiring harness. This results in improved system performance and potentially lower cost by eliminating EMI filtering components","","0-7803-3787-5","","10.1109/ICMCM.1997.581171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581171","","Crosstalk;Electromagnetic compatibility;Electromagnetic interference;Laminates;Multichip modules;Noise reduction;Predictive models;Routing;Software packages;Software testing","automotive electronics;crosstalk;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic interference;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit noise;multichip modules;network routing","EMI;Quantic software package;automotive electronics;conducted emission;coupled noise;crosstalk;design;electromagnetic compatibility;engine controller unit;laminate MCM;layout;motherboard;multichip module;simulation;substrate routing;surface mount package;wiring harness","","","","0","","3","","","20020806","02 Apr 1997-04 Apr 1997","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Resolvers and high-resolution encoders provide excellent measurement accuracy. However, market competition has forced designers to look into less expensive solutions that have relatively large measurement errors. This paper studies the effect of position sensor measurement errors on torque ripple performance of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The low cost sensor system considered here has a dual Hall sensor IC and a magnet wheel. The effect of relatively poor resolution and magnet wheel tolerance are simulated with Simulink models. With the same motor and controller model, a high performance resolver is also simulated. The simulation results of both types of sensor are compared. The torque ripple performance degradation due to lower cost sensor is identified. The results show an acceptable torque ripple with the lower cost sensor. A DSP based motor controller is built and tested with the dual Hall sensing system. The test results show a torque ripple of about 2 % for the complete motor drive with Hall position sensor. The Hall position sensor meets the smooth steering feel requirement that most EPS manufacturers have specified.","","0-7803-7817-2","","10.1109/IEMDC.2003.1211271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211271","","Costs;Error analysis;Magnetic sensors;Measurement errors;Motor drives;Permanent magnet motors;Sensor systems;Synchronous motors;Torque;Wheels","Hall effect transducers;automotive electronics;digital control;digital signal processing chips;error analysis;machine control;measurement errors;permanent magnet motors;position control;position measurement;synchronous motor drives;torque","DSP based motor controller;Hall position sensor;Simulink models;controller model;dual Hall sensing system;dual Hall sensor IC;electric power steering motor drive;high-resolution encoders;low cost sensor system;lower cost sensor;magnet wheel;magnet wheel tolerance;market competition;measurement errors;motor;permanent magnet synchronous motor;position sensor error analysis;position sensor measurement errors;resolvers;smooth steering;torque ripple;torque ripple performance;torque ripple performance degradation","","","","2","","","","","20030715","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do this, a FlexRay communication controller is modeled by Verilog HDL at the behavioral level. This HDL model of the controller is exploited to setup a FlexRay-based network composed of four nodes. The results of fault injection show that about 35% of faults led to the message missing failures.

Combining edge-oriented contour detection, corner detection and local prior template, the exact endpoints and curve segments are obtained. Finally, the segmented parametric feature lines are automatically fitted using cubic B¡äezier curves. Taking car body design as numerical examples, we establish the corresponding database.

Modeling and simulation provides a cost-effective measure to carry out preliminary component, system (hardware and software), and mission testing and verification, thereby reducing the number of potential failures in at-sea trials.

The affine invariance is exploited in the learning stage to produce a lightweight model: for an automobile cylinder head, a learning view-sphere with twelve viewpoints is sufficient. Moreover, during the learning stage, this descriptor is combined to a 2D/3D pattern, concept likewise presented in this article. Once associated, the 2D/3D information wealth of this descriptor allows a pose estimation from a single match between two descriptors. This ability is exploited to obtain efficiently a great number of coarse pose hypothesis. A pose hypothesis classification method is proposed to select the best-ones.

This makes the converter a first-order system, and the close loop control design becomes easy. The removal of the inductor reduces power loss during the operation. Moreover, soft switching using zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) reduces switching power losses. The proposed topology achieves high efficiency and high power density. The paper describes the analysis and design for the converter system under non-ideal conditions. The possible ZVS range of the load variation is also given. A large signal average model and a small signal model for the bi-directional converter are derived. Based on the system model, a digital PI controller is designed and is implemented by using an FPGA.

Lateral velocity and sideslip angle are regarded as the most important motion variables. However, it is not feasible during vehicle operation to directly measure them due to the high cost of sensors, limitations to sensor technology, etc. Therefore, the monitoring of lateral vehicle motion can be realized by using either accurate monitoring models or improved estimation algorithms. In this paper, monitoring models are obtained such that they utilize not only the vehicle dynamics but the cornering stiffness and the roll motion as well. Based on these monitoring models, three monitoring systems are constructed to estimate the vehicle velocity and the sideslip angle based on the sliding mode observer, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) including Dugoff's tire model, and the scaled Kalman filter with model error compensator (SKFMEC) methods, respectively.

To show the benefits of this new language applied to this specific business we model the engineer and manufacturing activity process using VDML.","1935-4576","978-1-4244-0851-1","978-1-4244-0851-1","10.1109/INDIN.2007.4384854","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384854","","Assembly systems;Automotive engineering;Costs;Manufacturing industries;Manufacturing processes;Process design;Space vehicles;Standards development;Unified modeling language;Virtual manufacturing","Unified Modeling Language;automobile industry;manufacturing data processing;vehicles","UML profile;VDML;automotive industry;business process description;engineering activity modeling;manufacturing activity modeling;vehicle development modeling language;vehicle development process","","","","0","","","","","20071119","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the ever increasing demands on passengers' comfort, safety, emissions, and fuel consumption imposed by car manufacturers and regulations call for more robust techniques and the use of cycle-accurate models. We argue that these models must be hybrid because of the combination of time-domain and event-based behaviors. We present a hybrid model of the engine in which both continuous and discrete time-domain as well as event-based phenomena are modeled in a separate but integrated manner. Based on this model, we formalize the specification of the overall engine control by defining a number of hybrid control problems. To cope with the difficulties arising in the design of hybrid controllers, a design methodology is proposed. This methodology consists of a relaxation of the hybrid problem by simplifying some of its components to obtain a solvable problem,and then deriving a solution to the original control problem by appropriately modifying the control law so obtained to take into consideration the original specifications and models. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated on three challenging problems: fast force-transient control, cutoff control, and idle speed control.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/5.871300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871300","","Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Engines;Force control;Fuels;Time domain analysis;Vehicle safety;Virtual manufacturing;Virtual prototyping","continuous time systems;control system synthesis;discrete time systems;internal combustion engines;velocity control","automotive engine control;car manufacturers;comfort;cutoff control;cycle-accurate models;emissions;engine control systems;event-based behaviors;fast force-transient control;fuel consumption;hybrid control problems;hybrid systems;idle speed control;regulations;safety;time-domain behaviours","","","","45","4","68","","","20020806","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The TEM needs to ultimately be able to operate from ~40°C on the cold side of the device up to a maximum of at least 650°C on the hot side. Using the thermo-mechanical models developed, thermo-mechanical loads have been modelled. The modelling results have then been used to select the packaging materials to ensure that the thermo-mechanical stresses on the TEM are manageable. The thermo-mechanical simulations were used to determine the best combination materials used for packaging and found that using W/AlN/W substrates on both the hot side and cold side of the module produces a maximum stress of ~130 MPa when 650°C is applied to the hot side and 45°C is applied to the cold side, which is below the AlN flexural stress of 600 MPa [2]. This indicates that it may be possible to produce a high temperature TEM that does not crack at the first instance when a large thermal gradient is applied.","","978-1-4673-6138-5","","10.1109/EuroSimE.2013.6529990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529990","","","Ge-Si alloys;Seebeck effect;nanostructured materials;semiconductor materials;thermal insulating materials;thermal stresses;thermoelectric conversion","Seebeck effect;SiGe;TE material;W-AlN-W;automotive industry;energy harvesters;exhaust systems;flexural stress;fuel consumption;greenhouse emissions;high temperature TEM;high temperature applications;large scale industrial applications;packaging materials;temperature 45 degC;temperature 650 degC;thermal electric modules;thermal gradient;thermally-insulating semiconductors;thermoelectric modules;thermomechanical loads;thermomechanical modelling;thermomechanical simulations;thermomechanical stresses;vehicle engines","","","","0","","35","","","20130613","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A capacitor plate model controller (CPMC) is designed for a certain type of Underwater Robot. A new control method: generalized S-plane controller (GSPC) is put forward based on the analysis of two new control methods, sigmoid S-plane control (SSPC) and capacitor plate model control. Generalized S-plane controller represents the essence of fuzzy control and has simple structure of PD control. Compared with fuzzy control, it fractionizes fuzzy rules, decreases the complexity when adjusting parameters and reduces the calculation. The two methods are applied to the Underwater Robots' simulation experiments and sea trials and plenty of results are obtained. The analysis of the results tells that when setting the same parameters, choosing a nonlinear S-model function with better astringency to substitute the sigmoid function used in sigmoid S-plane control, better results can be achieved. The validity of the proposed new controller is verified and it has some practical engineering values.","","978-1-4244-4754-1","978-1-4244-4738-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358309","Generalized S-plane;capacitor plate model controller(CPMC);controller compare;controller(GSPC);sigmoid S-plane control (SSPC);sigmoid function","Automotive engineering;Capacitors;Control systems;Fuzzy control;Laboratories;Motion control;Nonlinear control systems;PD control;Robot sensing systems;Underwater vehicles","control system synthesis;fuzzy control;mobile robots;nonlinear control systems;two-term control;underwater vehicles","PD control;capacitor plate model controller designing;fuzzy control;generalized S-plane controller;motion control;nonlinear S-model function;sigmoid S-plane control;underwater robot","","","","0","","11","","","20091228","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its main software includes a monitor software running in the monitor computer, a vision rendering software running in the vision computer and Matlab/Simulink-based simulation model running in simulation computer. When designing its monitor software, a graphical user interface driven-by S-function method is adopted to eliminate the delay in the displaying of the simulation data. The vision rendering software uses a parametric adjustment method based on the principle of optical projection, improving the driver's perception of being immersed in the virtual traffic scene. The application of the developed platform is demonstrated by HIL experiments of vehicle actuators and DIL experiments of adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm.

The control strategy used is a look-down reference system which uses a sensor at the front bumper to measure the lateral displacement and a GPS to measure the heading orientation. Firstly, the road curvature estimator is designed based on the steering angle. Secondly, the steering angles can be estimated by using the sensor and the GPS information. The estimation algorithm employed is an observer for a new extended system model, in which the steering angle and its derivative are viewed as two state variables. Then, the lateral displacements estimation and the control algorithm are investigated. An accurate and real-time estimation of the lateral displacements with respect to the road can be accomplished in such a control system. The closed loop controller is used as a compensator to control the lateral dynamics of the vehicle. The vehicle dynamic and control system are simulated with Matlab Simulink. The proposed estimation and control algorithms are validated by simulation results.

The main objective of the present study is to propose a semi-empirical capacity fading model of li-ion batteries being practical for predicting the degradation of battery capacity under real working conditions. The capacity fading of li-ion cells is considered to be mainly caused by side reaction, which consumes the active materials. The main contribution of the study is that the model is not founded only empirically based on the experiment results, but also with the theoretical description of side reaction based on Eyring equation. By this combined model, it is expected to get an accurate and meanwhile practical model for performance prediction. The model takes DOD, temperature and current rate as three main factors affecting ageing process. The ageing tests were designed and implemented to get the parameters of the capacity fading model, and one validation experiment was used to evaluate the prediction performance of the model. There is a good agreement between the actual capacity degradation and predicted capacity degradation.","","","","10.1109/VPPC.2013.6671660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671660","","","ageing;battery powered vehicles;secondary cells","EV;Eyring equation;ageing tests;electric vehicles;life prediction;secondary batteries;semiempirical capacity degradation model;semiempirical capacity fading model","","","","0","","","","","20131121","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cooperative collision warning based on vehicle-to-vehicle radio communications and GPS systems is one such promising active safety application that has evoked considerable interest among automobile manufacturers and research communities worldwide. In this paper, we address one of the key functional components of the cooperative collision warning application, which is, accurate estimation of relative positions of all the neighboring vehicles based on real-time exchange of their individual GPS position coordinates, and then we propose a novel system solution for achieving the same (relative positioning functionality) during persistent GPS outages. Our proposed system solution essentially involves integration of the most suitable set of vehicle clustering, radio based ranging, and relative position coordinate establishment techniques, and based on the results of a comprehensive literature survey, we reason that the two-way reciprocal time of arrival based ranging, and the distributed beacon-less relative positioning techniques may constitute the most viable set for our proposed system solution. Having developed a system simulator to accurately model the functionality of our proposed system solution, we then quantify the impact of various levels of ranging error on the overall performance of the system and thereby assess the functional viability of our proposed system solution. The simulation results look quite promising and support the fact that our proposed system solution can enable relative positioning of vehicles without any GPS information within acceptable levels of positioning accuracy, as required for the 360-degrees cooperative collision warning application","","4-901122-86-X","","10.1109/IVS.2006.1689660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1689660","active safety application;cooperative collision warning;performance evaluation;radio based ranging;relative positioning system;simulation results;system design;vehicle-to-vehicle communications","Automobile manufacture;Automotive engineering;Global Positioning System;Laboratories;Radio communication;Real time systems;Road accidents;Road vehicles;US Department of Transportation;Vehicle safety","Global Positioning System;automotive electronics;radionavigation;road safety","GPS outage;GPS system;Global Positioning System;active safety application;automotive safety;cooperative collision warning application;distributed beaconless relative positioning;neighboring vehicle clustering;radio ranging;real-time GPS position exchange;relative position coordinates;system simulator;vehicle relative position estimation;vehicle safety;vehicle-to-vehicle radio communication","","","","1","","24","","","20060911","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike VR technology, AR (Augmented Reality) technology superimposes required virtual objects on real time image of physical manufacturing environment. Therefore, modeling time and cost for new manufacturing system can be dramatically reduced using AR technology. In this paper, the methods of design and implementation by using AR technology for the automobile assembly process such as the automobile spare tire inserting are introduced. Moreover, methods such as a multi-marker coordinate system, a threshold image, a clipping plane for virtual objects and so on, are proposed to generate the operation program for the automobile assembly process.

Our preliminary results indicate that our proposal can achieve a substantial reduction in the number of objective function evaluations, which has obvious advantages for dealing with expensive objective functions such as those involved in aeronautical optimization problems.","","978-1-4673-1510-4","978-1-4673-1508-1","10.1109/CEC.2012.6256491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6256491","","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Automotive components;Computational fluid dynamics;Computational modeling;Optimization;Vectors","aerodynamics;aerospace components;design engineering;evolutionary computation","aeronautical optimization problems;airfoil aerodynamic designs;multiobjective airfoil shape optimization;multiple-surrogate approach;objective function;surrogate-based multiobjective evolutionary optimization","","","","1","","22","","","20120802","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main advantages of our approach are of two folds: (1) Analyzers only need to concentrate on one aspect each time, thus the complexity of the requirements modeling is decreased, and accordingly the models' understandability is enhanced, (2) The adoption of formal techniques allows us to simulate and verify the properties of the requirements in the early stage of development, therefore the quality of requirements can be improved.","","978-1-4244-9287-9","","10.1109/WCSE.2010.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718381","Architecture description language;Automotive software;Model-driven development;Requirements modeling;Timed automata","Actuators;Automata;Automotive engineering;Clocks;Driver circuits;Software;Transforms","automotive components;automotive electronics;formal verification;mechanical engineering computing","aspectual model;automotive software requirement modeling;electronic control unit development;formal modeling","","","","0","","8","","","20110222","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A whole skeleton model and a reduced model are built. All parts except chassis and floor assembly are reduced out using static reduction method. Reduced model is verified with finite element analysis (FEA) results compared with those from whole model. The study shows that a close agreement of computed results of whole and reduced models is obtained in terms of deformation and displacements at load-bearing nodes and normal mode shapes. While slight discrepancy in first mode frequencies is observed because the static condensation method for reduced model is approximate for mass matrix. As a result, the reduced model saves computation time by about 50 per cent compared to whole model. A structural size optimization is carried out for bus skeleton lightweight issue. Considering size specifications of structure members, three computer-aided engineering (CAE) models with fully discrete design variables, mixed design variables (combination of continuous and discrete variables) and fully continuous variables are built and solved respectively. A comprehensive comparison is examined on the basis of optimized results such as mass reduction, structural performance and computation cost. The results show that adopting the optimization model (scheme) with the reduced model and the mixed design variables, a compromise with 4 per cent mass-saving is obtained between lightweight objective and computing cost. Moreover, optimized results totally accord with size specifications of bus skeleton, which means no manual adjustment is required and makes the proposed method feasible for engineering application.","","978-1-4244-5537-9","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563779","bus skeleton;lightweight;mixed variables optimization;reduced model","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Deformable models;Load modeling;Numerical models;Optimization;Robustness","computer aided engineering;finite element analysis;lightweight structures;mechanical engineering computing;optimisation;vehicles","bus skeleton lightweight design;computer-aided engineering model;discrete design variable;finite element analysis;floor assembly;load-bearing node;mass reduction;mixed variable optimization;reduced model;structural size optimization","","","","0","","14","","","20100907","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We implemented a significance test for correlation and used this test to dynamically adjust the batch sizes used in confidence interval estimation done using batch means. When the stability conditions have been met, the simulation prompts the user to consider stopping the simulation. On the other hand, if at the end of the run length selected by the user, the statistical conditions were not satisfied, the tool notifies the user of that fact. This capability enabled us to significantly reduce the simulation run lengths, and ensures, with little additional computational effort, that the results were reliable.

We investigate multi-sensor systems composed of different sensor technologies and provide a methodical framework for the design of sensor based applications and the evaluation of a multi-sensor system regarding specific application requirements. We use both sensor and application characteristics to model the system and propose a metric that supports basic design decisions and assessment of alternative sensor systems at an early stage of system development.

First, a single synthesized matrix capable of modeling an entire system and storing all individual item matrices in a compact and efficient manner is developed. Second, a methodology based on the probabilistic combination of RPNs is improved further. An RPN is calculated for every cause of failure by multiplying together severity, occurrence, and detection ratings (values between one and ten). The probabilistic approach is used to calculate local and global priority indices (PIs) which reflect the importance of an event relating to the indenture level under consideration and to the entire system, respectively.

Complexity metrics, which describe how Â¿complexÂ¿ a possible part of a process is, are a means of doing so. Using them, every single element of a process (e.g. activities, resources,...) or groups of elements can be reviewed, and those exhibiting distinctive features can be further considered for improvement. Such metrics are especially of interest if no quantitative data is available but only the qualitative process architecture is at hand, e.g. as a process chart. In this paper, different metrics from software and workflow engineering (McCabe Complexity, Control-flow Complexity, Activity / Passivity) are used on a qualitative model of a process incorporating decision points. The process model is based on a Multiple-Domain Matrix extended to comprise Boolean operators that are typical for process models (i.e. AND, OR, and XOR).","","978-1-4244-2629-4","978-1-4244-2630-0","10.1109/IEEM.2008.4737906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737906","Complexity;DSM;decision points;process","Automotive engineering;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Design engineering;Process design;Product development;Software quality;Time to market","Boolean functions;design engineering;matrix algebra;production management","Boolean operators;complexity metrics;decision points;design processes;engineering process;multiple-domain matrices;process management;qualitative process architecture;structural metrics;workflow engineering","","","","1","","20","","","20090106","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, we describe a structural modeling and annotation of failure data for hardware architectural designs. Based on a top-down qualitative fault tree analysis, the classification of hardware failure modes in context of system behavior can be determined according to ISO 26262. Using these classifications and assumed failure rates, we facilitate a rapid quantitative safety analysis regarding evaluation of the hardware architectural metrics and evaluation of safety goal violations.","","","","10.1109/RSP.2013.6683960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6683960","","Context;Data models;Fault trees;Hardware;ISO standards;Measurement;Safety","ISO standards;automotive electronics;fault trees;network synthesis;road vehicles;safety","ISO 26262;failure data annotation;hardware architectural design compliant;hardware architectural metrics;hardware failure modes classification;qualitative fault tree analysis;rapid safety evaluation;road vehicles functional safety;structural modeling","","","","0","","","","","20131216","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the lack of a simple hardware design that is capable of modifying the fuzzy controller's parameters to adapt for any changes in the operation environment, or behavior of the plant system limits the applicability of fuzzy based control systems in the automotive and industrial environments. The design and implementation of an FPGA based fuzzy logic controller, that allows real-time modification of its membership functions and rule base is introduced in this paper. The development of the controller's architecture is carried out on a National Instruments Intelligent DAQ board (PCI-7833R) with a reconfigurable Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA. The proposed design combines the performance advantages of existing static FPGA based fuzzy control architectures, with the flexibility and ease of implementation of conventional micro-controllers and general purpose processors. To test the efficiency of the controller and its ability to stabilize a highly dynamic system, a semi-active suspension system was developed. Simulation results for the proposed FPGA controller showed a 56% characteristic enhancement over the standard passive suspension system.","","978-1-4244-8375-4","978-1-4244-8374-7","10.1109/ICAL.2010.5585344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585344","field programmable gate array;fuzzy logic control;hardware implementation;linear quadratic regulator;semi-active suspension system","Adaptation model;Control systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Fuzzy logic;Hardware;Optimization;Suspensions","adaptive control;field programmable gate arrays;fuzzy control;large-scale systems;microcontrollers;nonlinear dynamical systems;stability","FPGA;National Instruments Intelligent DAQ board;adaptive control;dynamic system;field programmable gate array;fuzzy control architecture;fuzzy logic control;general purpose processor;microcontroller;reconfigurable Xilinx Virtex-II;semiactive suspension system","","","","1","","15","","","20100923","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the costs of manufacturing such radar-based systems, capable of gathering reliable information from surroundings, for vehicles across the market spectrum or for compact executive cars are still too high. Thus, despite the improved reliability characteristics, detection properties and safety required for these sensors, the aim is to manufacture such systems more cost-effectively. The German national ldquoKRAFAS (Cost-optimized Radar Sensor for Active Driver Assistance Systems)rdquo project is aiming at integrating 77 GHz components (esp. SiGe MMICs) into a printed circuit board, combining driver and 77 GHz RF circuitry and integrating antenna elements. This will significantly reduce current costs of the 77 GHz RF module by 20-30%. A sketch of such a module with an adapted cylindrical radar lens is depicted in Figure 1. In this paper, design, simulation, technological development, demonstrator realization and subsequent measurement of interconnects of embedded active 77 GHz chips to a high frequency substrate using microvia technology is described.

This paper proposes a novel integrated power electronics interface (IPEI) for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in order to optimize the performance of the powertrain. The proposed IPEI is responsible for the power-flow management for each operating mode. In this paper, an IPEI is proposed and designed to realize the integration of the dc/dc converter, on-board battery charger, and dc/ac inverter together in the BEV powertrain with high performance. The proposed concept can improve the system efficiency and reliability, can reduce the current and voltage ripples, and can reduce the size of the passive and active components in the BEV drivetrains compared to other topologies.

In all cases, there is exactly a one-to-one correspondence between objects in the specification and the specifier's view of the objects in the system being specified. There is a straightforward mapping from the specification to an Ada implementation. The specifications are formal and support automatic consistency and completeness checking.

"Efficient power co-estimation techniques for system-on-chip design","Lajolo, M.; Raghunathan, A.; Dey, S.; Lavagno, L.","Politecnico di Torino, Italy","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition 2000. Proceedings","2000","2000","","","27","34","We present efficient power estimation techniques for HW/SW System-On-Chip (SOC) designs. Our techniques are based on concurrent and synchronized execution of multiple power estimators that analyze different parts of the SOC (we refer to this as co-estimation), driven by a system-level simulation master. We motivate the need for power co-estimation, and demonstrate that performing independent power estimation for the various system components can lead to significant errors in the power estimates, especially for control-intensive and reactive embedded systems. We observe that the computation time for performing power co-estimation is dominated by: (i) the requirement to analyze/simulate some parts of the system at lower levels of abstraction in order to obtain accurate estimates of timing and switching activity information and (ii) the need to communicate between and synchronize the various simulators. Thus, a naive implementation of power co-estimation may be too inefficient to be used in an iterative design exploration framework. To address this issue, we present several acceleration (speedup) techniques for power co-estimation. The acceleration techniques are energy caching, software power macromodeling, and statistical sampling. Our speedup techniques reduce the workload of the power estimators for the individual SOC components, as well as their communication/synchronization overhead. Experimental results indicate that the use of the proposed acceleration techniques results in significant (8× to 87×) speedups in SOC power estimation time, with minimal impact on accuracy. We also show the utility of our co-estimation tool to explore system-level power tradeoffs for a TCP/IP network interface card sub-system and an automotive controller","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840011","","Acceleration;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Control systems;Embedded system;Error correction;Independent component analysis;Information analysis;Performance analysis;System-on-a-chip","application specific integrated circuits;circuit simulation;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;iterative methods;low-power electronics","TCP/IP network interface card sub-system;automotive controller;communication/synchronization overhead;computation time;concurrent execution;energy caching;hardware-software codesign;iterative design exploration;power co-estimation techniques;reactive embedded systems;software power macromodeling;statistical sampling;switching activity information;synchronized execution;system-level power tradeoffs;system-level simulation master;system-on-chip design","","","","12","","23","","","20020806","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve a sinusoidal back electromotive force waveform, zero cogging torque and zero total ripple torque, the most important point to be considered is the elimination of higher harmonics in the air gap flux density. In this paper, the harmonics of the air gap flux density waveform is reduced by designing the magnet shape and magnetization direction using the level set based design optimization method. Multiple level set functions are employed to express several magnet segments with different magnetization directions. To control geometry complexity and improve the ease of manufacturing, a modified phase field model is implemented. The reaction-diffusion equation is solved to update the level set functions by the design sensitivity. A practical example shows that the optimal shapes of a permanent magnet with different magnetization directions can effectively mitigate the harmonics of the air gap flux density waveform.","0018-9464","","","10.1109/TMAG.2013.2246142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514760","Air gap flux density waveform;level set based design optimization method;magnet shape;magnetization direction;surface-mounted permanent magnet motor","","air gaps;electric potential;geometry;machine control;magnetisation;optimisation;permanent magnet motors;sensitivity","air gap flux density waveform design;back electromotive force;design optimization method;design sensitivity;geometry complexity control;high harmonics;level set method;magnet shape;magnetization direction;phase field model;reaction-diffusion equation;sinusoidal back electromotive force waveform;surface-mounted permanent magnet motor;torque waveform;zero cogging torque;zero total ripple torque","","","","0","","13","","","20130507","","IEEE","IEEE Magnetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, FMEA is traditionally done manually which makes it both time-consuming and costly, specially for large and complex systems. Also, small modifications in the design may result in a complete revision of the initial FMEA. This paper presents a tool support for automated incremental component-based FMEA of SW and HW. It is based on component safety interfaces and a formal compositional safety analysis method. This tool support enables engineers to focus on more important steps in the safety assessment process. Also, during system upgrades, the tool incrementally registers the changes and identifies possible effects in the FMEA which enables the use of earlier safety analysis results. Finally, this formal approach based on design models of the components and the system always creates FMEAs which are consistent with the system design.","","978-3-9810801-3-1","978-3-9810801-4-8","10.1109/DATE.2008.4484792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4484792","","Aerospace industry;Aerospace safety;Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Failure analysis;Hardware;Information analysis;Information science;Software safety;System analysis and design","object-oriented programming;safety-critical software;software fault tolerance","FMEA technique;automated incremental component-based FMEA;component safety interfaces;component-based fault tolerant systems;hardware complexity;incremental failure mode and effects analysis;safety assessment process;safety-critical systems;software complexity","","","","2","","18","","","20080411","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first phase is a geometric algorithm that assumes the part is rigid and computes vg-grips (vertex-groove grips). The vg-grip algorithm uses a fast sufficient test for immobility to generate a list of vg-grips and find bounds on jaw cone angles for each. The second phase is a fast heuristic procedure that uses FEM to arrange secondary contacts to reduce part deformation. For a part described by n concave ""virtual vertices"", a list of vg-grips and minimum half cone angles for each vg-grip can be generated in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time. We also propose a quality metric based on the sensitivity of the part's orientation to an infinitesimal relaxation of the jaws that can be evaluated in constant time for a given fixture.

For the purpose of improving force control performance of hydraulic hybrid systems, an online tuning force controller based quantitative feedback theory (QFT) technique is applied to the load simulator and also proposed in this paper. The controller is firstly designed to satisfy the robust performance requirement, tracking performance specification, and disturbance attenuation despite uncertainties of the load simulator system.

The design process of timing chain drives involves computer simulation of many design variants in order to find an optimum. Most of the simulation results can be represented as families of function graphs (data series). Previously, the analysis of those results was based on static 2D diagrams and animated 3D visualizations. They were suitable for the detailed analysis of a few simulation variants, but not for the comparison of many cases. In this paper we propose a new approach to the analysis based on coordinated linked views and advanced brushing features. Our proposed method supports the interactive analysis of many design variants. We introduce a novel view, called segmented curve view, which can display distributions in families of function graphs. The segmented curve view combines individual function graphs where for a fixed value of the independent variable, a bar extends from minimum to maximum values across the family of function graphs. Each bar is divided into segments (bins) with a color that represents the number of function graphs with the value in that segment. In the case study, we demonstrate that the new view combined with ""traditional"" views provides a strong support for the interactive visual exploration and analysis of a real world timing chain design problem.","","0-7695-2903-8","","10.1109/CMV.2007.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4269942","","Analytical models;Animation;Camshafts;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Data visualization;Drives;Process design;Timing;Valves","automotive components;camshafts;data visualisation;engines;graph theory;mechanical engineering computing","animated 3D visualizations;coordinated views;crankshaft;engine;function graphs;interactive visual analysis;segmented curve view;static 2D diagrams;timing chain drive;valves","","","","1","","21","","","20070716","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the authors propose a simple and practical two-stage approach of system reliability growth modeling considering components, functions, and failure modes. The consideration of these three dimensions will help in uncovering the weak spots in design responsible for low system reliability. The proposed method assumes Weibull distribution as failure time distribution and reliability model is based on the Bayesian framework incorporating even fuzzy information. The fuzzy logic model that has been developed for this purpose is used to quantify the engineering judgment or fuzzy information of reliability improvement attributed to design changes or corrective actions. Uncertainty in data/information at component levels propagates to system level reliability and makes system reliability prediction highly unreliable.

Main challenge refers to the configuration of accepted delays, taking into account the required memory consumption and execution times. The controller supports asynchronous exchanges of data, being able to handle certain communication delays. The discrete-time model of the closed-loop controller area network (CAN) based system is obtained by means of polytopic approximation techniques. The suggested embedded controller is designed according to one step ahead predictive control algorithm with flexible control Lyapunov function, assuming that the model admits polytopic uncertainty and hard constraints. If the Lyapunov function is appropriately chosen, the command computation involves solving a single linear program at each sampling period. The proposed approach is experimentally verified using an industrial test-bench setup consisting of a Freescale based electronic control unit (which implements the controller) linked via a CAN bus with a dSPACE MicroAutoBox plant simulator.","","978-1-4577-0683-7","978-0-7695-4418-2","10.1109/ECBS-EERC.2011.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6037516","communication delays;embedded system;networked control systems;predictive control;real-time operating system","Algorithm design and analysis;Delay;Engines;Lyapunov methods;Operating systems;Real time systems;Wheels","Lyapunov methods;automotive electronics;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;controller area networks;damping;delays;discrete time systems;embedded systems;networked control systems;predictive control","CAN;OSEK/VDX real-time operating system;closed-loop controller area network;communication delays;discrete-time model;embedded networked controller;flexible control Lyapunov function;polytopic approximation techniques;polytopic uncertainty;predictive control;vehicle driveline oscillations damping","","","","0","","19","","","20111010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the optimal slip ratio (which results in maximum tire-road friction) varies with the type of road, current methods are not efficient in the sense of achieving the shortest possible stopping distance. This paper introduces an efficient ABS, in which the brake commands directly maximize the longitudinal component of tire-road friction at each wheel of the vehicle independently. The tire-road friction is estimated using a torque balance equation at each wheel, and within those equations, real-time estimates of the effective radius of tire are used. A step-by-step algorithm for computing the brake commands that maximize the tire-road friction is also presented. Three challenging braking scenarios were tested using the comprehensive CarSim simulation environment. The results show that, in comparison to conventional ABS, our method significantly reduces the stopping distance and improves the vehicle stability.","0278-0046","","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2081951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587890","Braking;control systems;friction","Equations;Force;Friction;Mathematical model;Tires;Vehicles;Wheels","automotive engineering;braking;friction;mechanical stability;torque;tyres;vehicle dynamics","CarSim simulation environment;antilock braking;direct maximization;optimal slip ratio;step-by-step algorithm;tire road friction;torque balance equation;vehicle stability;wheel slip ratio","","","","6","","27","","2010-09-30","20110711","","IEEE","IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One major hurdle is the current reliance on outmoded field hardware and software. A systematic approach to traffic engineering software development could provide significant advantages with regard to software capability, flexibility and maintenance. Improved traffic controllers will likely be essential for many of the proposed intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) applications. This paper describes the roadway traffic control problem generally and introduces a computable language that can be used for constructing real time traffic control software. This computable language is designed to be configured by a graphical user interface that does not require extensive software engineering training to use, yet provides much more flexibility and capability than possible by simply changing program parameters. The model is based upon the function block metaphor commonly used for constructing robust and efficient real time industrial control systems. The software model has been implemented in C on an open architecture traffic controller (OATC) hardware platform and demonstrated under simulated conditions for applications such as signalized intersection control, ramp metering, and communications with existing traffic control devices.

However, the development process for these has by and large remained a manual, document led process. This inevitably leads to delays, interpretation errors and omissions which are often not identified until late in the process - when it is time consuming and expensive to change the design. Furthermore, the design has to be verified and validated from requirements through to the final implementation. Manual processes make this a laborious and thankless task. By utilising the powerful and flexible model based design process allowed by MATLABreg & Simulinkreg, this paper will show how complex and innovative new working methods can be developed to improve the design cycle. These will allow rapid modeling and testing of algorithms, before committing to the expense of development for the final hardware platform, and the resulting cost benefits achieved by avoiding late changes to the design.

At present, encapsulation of semiconductor devices is based on conventional material, which contains halogen, and antimony (Sb). Unfortunately, such elements are a hazard to the environment and health. The alternative is to replace these elements with environmentally friendly flame retardant system which is halogen-and antimony-free, thereby giving rise to the name of green molding compound. In this paper, five green and one conventional molding compounds are discussed. The intention is to select a green compound which has good performance in terms of processibility and reliability. The conventional compound serves as a reference for the five green compounds. The evaluation began with material characterisation which gave a preliminary insight into the general compound behaviour. During material characterisation, several relevant thermo-mechanical properties were compared, such as coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and glass temperature (Tg). Moisture absorption, adhesion strength, flexural modulus and filler content will also be discussed. Thereafter, thermal-mechanical simulation was performed to study the stress distribution of the test package with the different compounds. The test package was also subjected to preconditioning at JEDEC level 1 at a 3× 260°C reflow temperature to ascertain its extent of delamination at various interfaces. As the test package is used in automotive application, an additional 100x temperature cycling at -55°C/+150°C was included in the preconditioning condition. This is the standard practice for automotive products. With the results from the various evaluation models, the best green molding compound was selected and confirmed through an additional temperature cycling (TC) test at -55°C/+150°C 1000x.","1089-8190","0-7803-7933-0","","10.1109/IEMT.2003.1225886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225886","","Encapsulation;Flame retardants;Hazards;Semiconductor device manufacture;Semiconductor device packaging;Semiconductor devices;Semiconductor materials;Temperature;Testing;Thermal stresses","antimony;design for environment;finite element analysis;halogens;moulding;semiconductor device packaging;thermal expansion","-55 degC;150 degC;additional temperature cycling test;adhesion strength;antimony;automotive products;conventional material;evaluation models;finite element analysis;flexural modulus;free package;friendly flame retardant system;general compound behaviour;glass temperature;green molding compound;green packaging;halogen;material characterisation;moisture absorption;processibility;reliability;semiconductor devices;semiconductor manufacturing;stress distribution;test package;thermal expansion coefficient;thermal-mechanical simulation;thermo-mechanical properties","","","","1","","4","","","20030904","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The potential to achieve dynamic composition of services has driven recent research efforts. To this end it is crucial to find solutions in order to automate this task. In the present paper, we propose a methodology which deals with these insufficiencies on two levels. The first level is the design. Based on teleological reasoning, each service is related to a goal which is represented by a conceptual model called an ontology. Services are described by a functional model which relies on a core reasoning process between interacting functional components of the complex system. The process is based on information flow (IF) approach, where the main idea is the fusion of goal ontologies. The second level is the implementation through multi agent systems (MAS). We propose an algorithm describing the mechanism of the dynamic fusion of services, in which the intelligent agents support the functional components of the complex system","","1-4244-01996-8","1-4244-01996-8","10.1109/IS.2006.348391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4155398","","Artificial intelligence;Automotive engineering;Command and control systems;Intelligent agent;Intelligent systems;Ontologies;Power system modeling;Runtime;Vehicle dynamics;Web services","distributed processing;inference mechanisms;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","artificial intelligence;core reasoning;distributed systems;functional model;fusion process;goal ontologies;information flow;intelligent agents;multiagent systems;teleological reasoning","","","","0","","","","","20070423","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The focus of this paper is to evaluate and analyze static occupant classification using a low-resolution range sensor, which is based on the time-of-flight principle. This range sensor is advantageous, since it provides directly a dense range image that is independent of the ambient illumination conditions and object textures. Herein, the realization of an occupant-classification system, using a novel low-resolution range image sensor, is described, methods for extracting robust features from the range images are investigated, and different classification methods are evaluated for classifying occupants. Bayes quadratic classifier, Gaussian mixture-model classifier, and polynomial classifier are compared to a clustering-based linear-regression classifier using a polynomial kernel. The latter one shows improved results compared to the first-three classification methods. Full-scale tests have been conducted on a wide range of realistic situations with different adults and child seats in various postures and positions.

It facilitates detailed “budget” level cost estimates. It has been successfully applied to a major satellite concept development. The CEM described is comprised of integrated detailed engineering and cost estimating relationships describing the performance, characteristics, and design parameters of the components and subsystems required for a space-based infrared sensing system. Models have been developed to evaluate design parameters. The automated interconnectivity between subsystem models using spreadsheet software allows for the quick assessment of the system design impacts due to requirement changes.

"Numerical simulation to the effect of rotation on blade boundary layer of horizontal axial wind turbine","Xiang Gao; Jun Hu","Coll. of Energy & Power Eng., Nanjing Univ. of Aeronaut. & Astronaut., Nanjing, China","World Non-Grid-Connected Wind Power and Energy Conference (WNWEC), 2010","5-7 Nov. 2010","2010","","","1","4","Two-dimensional blade element/momentum theory (BEMT) is often used in designing and calculating the performance of the blades of the wind turbine. However, in stalled conditions, the wind turbine rotor power output is under-predicted. This phenomenon, in which there are differences between the measured performances and predications based on 2D aerofoil characteristics in stalled condition, is so-called stall-delay. The reason for the stall delay has been the cause of much discussion, but a convincing physical process has not yet been established. What is agreed is that, for whatever reason, the adverse pressure gradient experienced by the flow passing over the downwind surface of the blade is reduced by the blade's rotation. The adverse pressure gradient slows down the flow as it approaches the trailing edge of the blade after the velocity peak reaches close the leading edge. In the boundary layer viscosity also slows down the flow and the combination of the two effects, and if sufficiently large, can bring the boundary layer flow to a standstill (relative to the blade surface) or even cause a reversal of flow direction. When flow reversal takes place, the flow separates from the blade surface and stall occurs, giving rise to loss of lift and a dramatic increase in pressure drag. This paper is aimed at describing the effect of rotation on the blade boundary layer of a wind turbine by solving the 3D- and 2D-NS equations. An NREL Phase VI test turbine is used as the numerical model. The grid is generated in ANSYS ICEM 12.0. Both Hex and Tetra mesh are used to increase the accuracy with small-scale computations. Commercial code FLUENT and the MRF method were chosen to solve the fluid fields around 3D wind turbine blade and 2D airfoil. We found that, compared with 2D airfoil, the stall on 3D blade is postponed due to the rotation and the separation point is delayed with the increase of rotation speed or decrease of the blade spanwise position.","","978-1-4244-8920-6","978-1-4244-8921-3","10.1109/WNWEC.2010.5673127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673127","Computational Fluid Dynamics;rotation effect;stall delay","Automotive components;Blades;Mathematical model;Rotors;Three dimensional displays;Wind speed;Wind turbines","blades;computational fluid dynamics;mesh generation;rotors;viscosity;wind turbines","2D aerofoil characteristics;2D-NS equations;ANSYS ICEM 12.0;FLUENT;Hex mesh;MRF method;Tetra mesh;blade boundary layer;blade element-momentum theory;flow reversal;horizontal axial wind turbine;pressure drag;pressure gradient;separation point;stall-delay;wind turbine rotor power output","","","","1","","6","","","20101223","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Todaypsilas restraint systems typically include a number of airbags, and a three-point seat belt with load limiter and pretensioner. In the class of realtime controlled restraint systems, the restraint actuator settings are continuously manipulated during the crash. The control strategy developed here is based on reference management, in which a nonlinear device - a reference governor - is added to a primal closed loop controlled system. This governor determines an optimal setpoint in terms of injury reduction and constraint satisfaction by solving a constrained optimization problem. Prediction of the vehicle motion, required to predict future constraint violation, is included in the design and is based on linear regression of past crash data. Simulation results with a MADYMO model show that a significant injury reduction is possible, without prior knowledge of the crash. Furthermore, it is shown that the algorithms are sufficiently fast to be implemented on-line.","","978-1-4244-2359-0","978-1-4244-2360-6","10.1109/ICVES.2008.4640864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4640864","","Actuators;Belts;Computer crashes;Constraint optimization;Control systems;Injuries;Nonlinear control systems;Real time systems;Vehicle crash testing;Vehicles","automotive components;belts;closed loop systems;nonlinear control systems;optimisation;regression analysis;road safety;safety devices;seats","airbags;closed loop controlled system;constrained optimization problem;constraint satisfaction;controlled belt restraint systems;injury reduction;linear regression;real-time controlled restraint systems;reference governors;restraint actuator settings;three-point seat belt;vehicle motion prediction","","","","1","","22","","","20081010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assessing interaction designs for in-car assistance services is an emerging and vibrant field of research. To avoid situations of possibly fatal danger when assessing driver assistance services in real driving situations, we propose trace-driven simulation to steer the experiments with users in a automotive driving simulator. Based on our own developments of driver assistance systems involving the sense of touch, i.e. exploiting haptics as a communication channel in vehicle-to-driver interactions, we demonstrate how pre-recorded traces of driving situations can control user studies. Our experiments show, that simulated driving journeys is a viable alternative to the more hazardous ""on-the-road"" user studies. With respect to haptics as an additional channel of communication we find that vibro-tactile stimuli are a promising means to raise driver attention when the visual and auditive channels fail due to overload.","1550-6525","978-0-7695-3425-1","","10.1109/DS-RT.2008.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700123","Driving Performance;Haptic Perception;Multimodal Interfaces;Realtime;Trace-Driven Simulation;User-centered Design;Vibro-tactile Feedback","Computational modeling;Driver circuits;Ear;Eyes;Face detection;Haptic interfaces;Lighting;Performance loss;Pervasive computing;Real time systems","digital simulation;driver information systems;embedded systems;haptic interfaces","automotive driving simulator;communication channel;driver assistance assessment;driver assistance services;driver assistance systems;driving safety;embedded systems technology;haptics;in-car assistance services;interface designs;microelectronics;simulation driven experiment control;trace-driven simulation;vehicle-to-driver interactions;vibro-tactile stimuli;wayfinding","","","","1","","28","","","20081208","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current approach for developing mobile applications appears to focus on utilizing template-based application-development kits provided by platform developers (e.g., Google's Android, Apple's iOS, or Nokia's Symbian) to capture application designs and install them on the runtime platforms through use of code generators tied to particular versions of the platform.

In this paper, a modeling tool that has been developed to study automotive systems using the power electronics simulator (PSIM) software is presented. PSIM was originally made for simulating power electronic converters and motor drives. This user-friendly simulation package is able to simulate electric/electronic circuits; however, it has no capability for simulating the entire system of an automobile. This paper discusses the PSIM validity as an automotive simulation tool by creating module boxes for not only the electrical systems, but also the mechanical, energy-storage, and thermal systems of the vehicles. These modules include internal combustion engines, fuel converters, transmissions, torque couplers, and batteries.

In this paper, DFMEA (design failure mode and effects analysis) and FTA (fault tree analysis) complied with ISO 26262 are taken to analyze the safety aspects of EPS so as to enhance the safety and reliability of EPS. Firstly, the EPS system is decomposed into subsystems and components, and the familiar failure modes and undesired top events are separately divided into several categories. Then a comprehensive DFMEA for every single potential failure mode is carried out without omission as far as possible. The qualitative FTA is put into practice to identify the weak link as well. Since the DFMEA and FTA for EPS are finished, countermeasures for each potential hazard should be taken to guarantee the safety and reliability of EPS which are always achieved by fault detection and fault isolation algorithms of EPS hardware and software. Besides, some preventive actions are also taken in the early design stage to find out the potential causes.","","978-1-4799-1014-4","","10.1109/QR2MSE.2013.6625550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625550","DFMEA;EPS;FTA;ISO 26262;preventive actions;system structure tree","Automotive engineering;ISO standards;Power systems;Reliability engineering;Safety;Torque","IEC standards;ISO standards;automotive components;fault diagnosis;fault trees;hazards;road safety;steering systems","DFMEA;EPS hardware;EPS software;EPS system;FTA;IEC 61508;ISO 26262;V-model;car;design failure mode and effects analysis;electric power steering system;fault detection algorithm;fault isolation algorithm;fault tree analysis;hazard;product development;reference process model;reliability improvement;safetycritical system","","","","0","","","","","20131010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve the prescribed dynamic performance, a performance index describing converged speed of system states is established based on the model-building of SCDCS that is networked on its state feedback loop. Meanwhile, a sufficient condition, which can guarantee SCDCS to be asymptotically stable under prescribed performance constraints, is derived by employment of the Lyapunov theory and the matrix measurement. Based on the condition, an algorithm for obtaining maximum allowable transfer interval is presented. Results of simulation indicate that the design method is less conservative and can not only guarantees system asymptotically stable, but also make it have desired dynamic performance.","","978-1-4244-2692-8","978-1-4244-2693-5","10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5246395","maximum allowable transfer interval;prescribed performance;safety critical DCS","Actuators;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Distributed control;Electrical equipment industry;Industrial control;Performance analysis;Stability;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicle safety","Lyapunov methods;asymptotic stability;control system synthesis;distributed control;matrix algebra;safety systems;state feedback","Lyapunov theory;asymptotic stablility;design method;distributed control system;matrix measurement;maximum allowable transfer interval;prescribed performance constraints;safety critical DCS;state feedback loop","","","","0","","14","","","20090918","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Integrated Starter Generator: The Need for an Optimal Design and Control Approach. Application to a Permanent Magnet Machine","Chedot, L.; Friedrich, G.; Biedinger, M.; Macret, P.","Valeo Electr. Syst., Creteil","Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on","March-april 2007","2007","43","2","551","559","This paper proposes to apply optimal approaches to the design and control of a highly constrained electric machine. The developed approach is applied on a permanent-magnet integrated starter generator (ISG) but may be applied on any high-constrained electric machine. One of the main problems in the use of optimal approaches is the accuracy of the models used by the optimizer. In our approach, we propose to proceed in two steps. 1) Optimal design: the model is purely analytic, and some phenomena are neglected (cross saturation). Under these conditions, the electric machine design is optimal for a limited number of constraints. The design model uses a classic uncoupled d,q reluctant circuit model (with saturation taken into account). 2) Optimal control: once the machine is calculated, the design constraints are validated by a finite-element (FE) method. The FE method allows to use a more accurate model to compute optimal currents for the control on the whole torque-speed plane. In our case, we use FE results to model the cross-saturation phenomenon. The optimizer is common to both cases and is a classic commercial sequential quadratic programming algorithm. This model is validated by experimental results based on an ISG. This paper shows that optimal design and control allows for permanent-magnet machine, high flux-weakening mode, and high-efficiency operations even for a simple machine structure","0093-9994","","","10.1109/TIA.2006.889900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4132859","Automotive applications;cross saturation;design optimization;interior permanent-magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM);optimal control","Circuits;Constraint optimization;Electric machines;Finite element methods;Induction generators;Iron;Optimal control;Permanent magnet machines;Quadratic programming;Torque control","control system synthesis;design engineering;finite element analysis;machine control;optimal control;permanent magnet generators;quadratic programming;starting;torque","cross-saturation phenomenon;finite element method;flux-weakening mode;high-constrained electric machine design;high-efficiency operations;optimal control;optimal design;permanent magnet integrated starter generator;quadratic programming algorithm;reluctant circuit model;torque-speed plane","","","","21","","43","","","20070319","","IEEE","IEEE Industry Applications Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Without additional compensation this approach can also lead to a significant degradation in idle speed control, ISC, disturbance rejection response. In this paper an analysis of ISC lead compensation, feed-forward and disturbance observer design techniques is presented, for ISC systems with minimal spark reserve levels. The integration of the disturbance observer within the ISC system is analyzed, including the impact of observer torque reconstruction techniques and unknown delays on the idle speed disturbance rejection response. Simulation results are used to show that the best combination of disturbance rejection response and delay variation robustness can be achieved by setting the observer torque input to zero. A high fidelity cylinder-by-cylinder nonlinear engine model and ISC simulation are used to validate the linear simulation results. The nonlinear simulation results confirm that setting the disturbance observer torque input to zero produces the best overall result with a 30 percent reduction in the maximum drop in engine speed when compared to an ISC with no lead or disturbance observer compensation. Further the disturbance rejection response compares favorably with responses from conventional ISC with high levels of spark reserve","","1-4244-0209-3","1-4244-0210-7","10.1109/ACC.2006.1656380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656380","","Automotive engineering;Degradation;Delay;Engines;Feedforward systems;Fuel economy;Petroleum;Sparks;Torque;Velocity control","compensation;delays;feedforward;fuel systems;internal combustion engines;nonlinear control systems;observers;poles and zeros;robust control;torque control;velocity control","automotive engine idle speed control;compensation;cylinder-by-cylinder nonlinear engine model;delay;disturbance observers;feedforward;gasoline engine fuel economy;observer torque reconstruction;robustness;spark reserve;spark retard;zero","","","","2","","9","","","20060724","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a fixture kinematic analysis based on the full kinematics of locator-workpiece contact. This model incorporates a ""virtual"" kinematic chain with meshing parameters of contact kinematics in a velocity formulation. Conditions of a deterministic fixture are derived. It is shown that the workpiece position and orientation are completely characterized by the kinematic properties of the locator contacts with the workpiece, including not only the arbitrary locator location errors but also the surface properties at non-prismatic locator-workpiece contacts.

A four wheel drive parallel hybrid electric vehicle is built by assembling an auxiliary electrical machine and battery group. Some preliminary instrumentation such as accelerator pedal, brake, clutch pedal position sensors and gear ratio estimation are realized to split torque demand into the two power sources. The first power source is the internal combustion engine and the second one is the permanent magnet electric motor. A rule-based control strategy is developed by setting transition rules between the two power sources. The control strategy is implemented on a proof-of-concept vehicle and road tested. In order to satisfy smooth transient switching between the two power sources, and in order not to disturb the driver by abrupt or retarded transitions, torque splitting is achieved by taking the power source dynamics and vehicle dynamics in the longitudinal direction into account. The internal combustion engine is not operated at its high emission and low fuel efficient regions. Regenerative braking is implemented to charge the electric motor battery pack during braking.","","0-7803-9797-5","0-7803-9797-5","10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776640","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776640","Automotive control;hybrid electric vehicle control;hybrid electric vehicle modeling;rule-based control","Assembly;Batteries;Electric motors;Hybrid electric vehicles;Instruments;Internal combustion engines;Magnetic sensors;Torque;Vehicle dynamics;Wheels","","","","","","3","3","11","","","20090206","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies show how communication capabilities should be supported by artificial intelligence systems capable of automating many of the decisions to be taken by emergency services, thereby adapting the rescue resources to the severity of the accident and reducing assistance time. To improve the overall rescue process, a fast and accurate estimation of the severity of the accident represent a key point to help the emergency services to better estimate the required resources. This paper proposes a novel intelligent system which is able to automatically detect road accidents, notify them through vehicular networks, and estimate their severity based on the concept of data mining and knowledge inference. Results show that a complete Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, with an adequate selection of relevant features, allows generating estimation models able to predict the severity of new accidents.

These boundaries are therefore detected by thresholding estimated Gaussian curvatures for each vertex. A component labeling operation is then performed to grow non-boundary vertices into parts. The original contributions of this paper include: (i) novel, curvature analysis-based decomposition of 3-D models represented by triangle meshes into functional parts instead of surfaces and (ii) large mesh (over 100,000 triangles) handling capability with low computational cost and easy implementation.

In addition, the LCRSM methods have substantially lower modeling errors and greater expected savings compared with alternatives with comparable numbers of runs, including small composite designs and computer-generated designs based on popular criteria such as D-optimality. Therefore, when simulation runs are expensive, low cost response surface methods can be used to create regression meta-models for queuing or other system optimization. The LCRSM procedures are also apparently the first experimental design methods derived as the solution to a simulation optimization problem. For these reasons, we say that LCRSM are “for and from” simulation optimization. We compare the proposed LCRSM methods with a large number of alternatives based on six criteria.

Two new variants of feature descriptors are described, generally named as point - triplet descriptors because they require three vertices to be computed. The first is related to the classical depth map feature, which is referred to as weighted - interpolated depth map. The second variant of descriptors are derived from an implicit RBF model, they are referred to as surface RBF signature (SRS) features. Both variants of descriptors are able to encode surface information within a triangular region defined by a point - triplet into a surface signature, which could be useful not only for 3D face processing but also within a number of graph based retrieval applications. These descriptors are embedded into a system designed to localise the nose - tip and two inner - eye corners. Landmark localisation performance is reported by computing errors of estimated landmark locations against our respective ground --truth data from the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) database.","","978-1-4577-1879-3","","10.1109/CERMA.2011.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125821","3D face processing;landmark localisation;point-triplet descriptors","Computational modeling;Face;Histograms;Surface treatment;Three dimensional displays;Training data;Vectors","eye;face recognition;feature extraction;graph theory;interpolation;radial basis function networks;stereo image processing","3D face processing;3D facial landmark localisation;3D image;Face Recognition Grand Challenge database;depth map feature;facial pose;facial surface;graph based retrieval application;inner-eye corners;nose-tip localisation;point-triplet descriptor;radial basis function model;surface RBF signature feature;surface descriptor;surface information;triangular region;unstructured face data;weighted-interpolated depth map","","","","0","","15","","","20120109","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model is based on the electrode heat transport equation, solved using the finite elements method. It is found that the ECM predicts in a satisfactory way the cathode voltage drop over a wide range of work conditions. The obtained results were compared with those reported in the current literature.

Current approaches provide partial solutions for the synthesis of a deployment model on distributed platforms, as either the allocation or the mapping is fixed a-priori. In order to tackle this problem we propose an optimization technique, based on two different mathematical programming formulations, to handle optimization of both allocation and mapping.

A good diagnostic tool enables a user to analyze a failed system and identify the failed components. While the field of diagnostics is not a modern one, the way in which system diagnostics are performed is continuously changing. The automatic diagnosis based on reliability analysis (ADORA) methodology utilizes reliability information developed during the design phase to build a diagnostic map. Previous work on ADORA demonstrated how a diagnostics procedure can be performed on a system that has been analyzed using a static reliability model, particularly a fault tree (Assaf and Dugan, 2003). In this article, we extend the ADORA methodology to utilize reliability analysis of dynamic fault trees (DFTs), which are reliability models that capture sequences and combinations of component failures that induce system failure. DFTs are particularly well suited for analyzing computer-based systems.As an example the common rail fuel injection system is discussed.","1094-6969","","","10.1109/MIM.2005.1502449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1502449","","Boolean functions;Data structures;Decision trees;Failure analysis;Fault trees;Performance analysis;Pressure control;Regulators;System testing;Vehicle dynamics","Markov processes;automotive engineering;computational complexity;decision trees;fault diagnosis;fault trees;maintenance engineering","ADORA methodology;Markov models;Markov processes;automatic diagnosis;common rail fuel injection system;computational complexity;diagnostic decision trees;diagnostic importance factors;dynamic fault trees;fault diagnosis;fuel systems;reliability analysis;static reliability model;system diagnostics","","","","1","1","13","","","20050906","","IEEE","IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The problem formulation provides a systematic approach toward the synthesis and techinical evaluation of a large class and future systems employing automatically controlled single-mode or dual-mode vehicles on intracity guideway networks. Important system engineerig problems--common to some degree to all proposed concepts--are defined and the associated control requirements are discussed. Basic performance criteria, the weighted average travel time and relative safety of travel, are formulated. Tradeoffs between important system parameters are identified and their relations to performance and cost are discussed. Analysis of system operation is based upon idealized models in which perfect information and control are assumed. Upper bounds on performance are thus obtained, and the main constraints are identified. The degradation of system performance resulting from random arrivals and departures is thereafter analyzed quantitatively. Finally, control problems arising from the use of short headways are discussed. The objective of the paper is to help develop a systematic approach to the design of automated transportation systems using digital computers and modern electronic communications. It concentrates on the functional system problems of relatively simple networks, which lend themselves to direct analytical approaches and which constitute a point of departure for more complex networks.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/PROC.1968.6339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1448269","","Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Costs;Land transportation;Network synthesis;Safety;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","","","","","","5","1","18","","","20050628","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since they equally refer to software and hardware components in which they are implemented, these models call for more heterogeneous design languages, with a larger granularity range too. At the level of design and verification languages, some standards have risen up, like UML, AADL, but none of them is driven by a standard methodology. To be able to follow the requirements traceability, at each step of the life cycle, we need a methodology that states for bidirectional links between each granularity level and each development level. In this article, we propose an approach based on systematic reuse of low-level concepts (borrowed from an algorithm language like +CAL and a programming language like Ada) into encapsulated algorithm structures which are implemented into the highest conceptual levels of development (e.g. from the UML and AADL component models). These structures are only activated and enriched as they advanced with the life cycle.

The existing force sensor technologies are limited in their use in commercial products by either cost issues or susceptibility to electromagnetic noise. Inverse Magnetostriction has been used to measure strain in controlled environments since its discovery by Joule in 1847, but not in practical applications due to a lack of data on how magnetic material properties change with environmental conditions such as temperature. Utilizing an innovative noise-reducing self-inductance design, this paper presents the basis for an inverse-magnetostrictive compressive load sensor. A lumped-parameter model for the change in sensor inductance under load, due to both mechanical and magnetic effects, is derived. The material properties of a magnetostrictive iron alloy are empirically determined over a broad range of loads and temperatures. The model and material properties are confirmed by testing a prototype force sensor. The prototype measures compressive forces from 100 to 25 000 N over a temperature range of 20 degC to 120 deg with a typical error of +/-2% (4% max). The sensor does experience significant thermal hysteresis for which the model does not currently account. This work was motivated by the need for a force sensor in an automobile electric brake system and used a single iron alloy (50% Ni), but the model and testing procedure provide a roadmap for future research to improve the performance and capabilities of such a sensor","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2006.886876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4066967","Force sensor;inverse magnetostriction;strain;temperature variation","Force sensors;Magnetic materials;Magnetic noise;Magnetic sensors;Magnetostriction;Material properties;Mechanical sensors;Strain measurement;Temperature sensors;Working environment noise","force sensors;inductance;magnetic permeability;magnetostriction","20 to 120 C;automobile electric brake;compressive load sensor;electromagnetic noise;force sensor;inverse magnetostriction;magnetic permeability;self-inductance;temperature variation;thermal hysteresis","","","","3","1","13","","","20070122","","IEEE","IEEE Sensors Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To ensure a smooth clutch to clutch shift, appropriate controls for two consecutive processes are critical. One is the precise coordination between the on-coming and off-going clutches, which requires the on-coming clutch to be filled and ready for engagement at the predetermined time (clutch fill). The other is the proper torque control during clutch engagement. In this paper, we will investigate the closed-loop “wet” clutch control enabled by a pressure sensor in the clutch chamber. The main challenges of the pressure-based “wet” clutch control lie in the complex nonlinear dynamics due to the interactions between the fluid and the mechanical systems, the ON/OFF behavior of the clutch assembly, the time-varying clutch loading condition, the required short time duration for a precise and robust clutch shift, and the lack of the displacement information. To enable precise and robust pressure-based control, this paper focuses on the following three aspects. First, a clutch dynamic model is constructed and validated, which precisely captures the system dynamics in a wide pressure range. Second, a sliding-mode controller is designed to achieve robust pressure control while avoiding the chattering effect. Finally, an observer is constructed to estimate the clutch piston motion, which is not only a necessary term in the nonlinear controller design but also a diagnosis tool for the clutch fill process. To validate the proposed methods, a transmission clutch fixture has been designed and built in the laboratory. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller and observer.","1083-4435","","","10.1109/TMECH.2011.2106507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720545","Automotive transmission;clutch dynamics;pressure-based control;sliding-mode control","Dynamics;Force;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Pistons;Springs;Valves;Vehicle dynamics","automobiles;closed loop systems;clutches;nonlinear dynamical systems;pistons;power transmission (mechanical);pressure control;pressure sensors;robust control;variable structure systems","automatic transmissions;automotive transmissions;closed-loop wet clutch control;clutch chamber;clutch fill process;clutch piston motion;clutch shift control;clutch to clutch shift;complex nonlinear dynamics;dual clutch transmissions;high-performance transmission designs;hybrid transmissions;mechanical systems;on-off behavior;pressure sensor;pressure-based clutch control;pressure-based control;robust pressure control;sliding-mode controller","","","","2","1","","","2011-02-28","20120427","","IEEE","ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A differential braking control law based on vehicle planar motion has been designed using a three-degree-of-freedom yaw plane vehicle model. The control threshold for the VSC is designed based on the vehicle body side slip angle. Since VSC always works with the driver, the overall vehicle performance will depend not on how well the VSC works but rather on its interaction with the human driver. Vehicle behavior and interactions between the vehicle, the controller, and the human driver are investigated using a vehicle simulator on a virtual test track (VTT). The VTT consists of a real-time vehicle simulator, a visual animation engine, a visual display, and human-vehicle interfaces. The VTT has been developed and used for the evaluation of the VSC under various realistic conditions in the laboratory. In this paper, the effects of the different control threshold on the vehicle-driver-controller interaction for a novice and expert driver are compared. Test results obtained using the VTT establish the need for a variable control threshold. The VTT makes it possible to perform exhaustive design trials and evaluations in the laboratory without risk of injury before field testing and promises to significantly reduce development cost and cycle time.","1063-6536","","","10.1109/TCST.2005.863649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597193","Control threshold;differential braking;human-in-the-loop evaluation;side slip angle;vehicle stability control;virtual test track","Animation;Automotive electronics;Biological system modeling;Engines;Humans;Laboratories;Motion control;Stability;Testing;Vehicle driving","motion control;position control;road vehicles;stability;traffic engineering computing","differential braking control;human-vehicle interfaces;side slip angle-based vehicle stability control schemes;vehicle planar motion;vehicle simulator;virtual test track;visual animation engine;visual display;yaw plane vehicle model","","","","12","","22","","","20060221","","IEEE","IEEE Control Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is a need, therefore, for simulation and design tools based on reduced models that will enable rapid, system-level, thermal-fluidic analyses. In this paper, we describe a multi-resolution flow-thermal simulation approach and prototype software tool for thermal management of electronics packages in large systems. This method offers higher efficiency than CFD analyses in terms of computational resources and time. Our demonstration example is related to flow-thermal analysis of a simple vehicle model containing multiple electronics packages. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used for rapid modeling of the electronics components and subsystems. The tool is capable of performing fully-resolved (CFD), mixed-resolution (CFD-ANN), and reduced-model (ANN) flow-thermal simulations. Coupled CFD-ANN simulations are a powerful method for design and thermal management of electronics packages and other electrical-mechanical components in large multi-component systems","1087-9870","0-7803-9524-7","","10.1109/ITHERM.2006.1645414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645414","","Analytical models;Computational fluid dynamics;Computational modeling;Electronic packaging thermal management;Power system management;Power system modeling;Thermal loading;Thermal management;Thermal management of electronics;Vehicles","automotive electronics;computational fluid dynamics;neural nets;thermal analysis;thermal management (packaging)","artificial neural networks;computational fluid dynamics;electrical-mechanical components;electronics components;electronics packages;flow-thermal analysis;mixed-resolution flow thermal simulation;multicomponent systems;multiresolution flow thermal simulation;prototype software tool;thermal management","","","","0","","6","","","20060705","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Hardware-in-the-loop-simulation of a vehicle climate controller with a combined HVAC and passenger compartment model","Michalek, D.; Gehsat, C.; Trapp, R.; Bertram, T.","Behr-Hella Thermocontrol GmbH, Lippstadt","Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics. Proceedings, 2005 IEEE/ASME International Conference on","24-28 July 2005","2005","","","1065","1070","A good example for a complex mechatronic system is a modern vehicle. It covers a lot of subsystems which solve different tasks but are often coupled. The automatic air conditioning system is one of those subsystems. It consists, especially in vehicles of higher categories, of a high number of distributed mechatronic actuators and sensors and a central controller. The aim of such a system is to achieve a desired climatic condition in the vehicle interior which leads to a higher comfort for the passengers and therefore it also increases indirect the safety in road traffic. The climatic condition is defined by the interior temperature, its layering, the humidity and the velocity of the airflow blowing through the passenger compartment. For the adjustment of the desired interior climate with the available air conditioning components complex control algorithms are necessary. This control task is performed by the climate controller, which includes all control strategies in form of software programs. Beneath the construction of all system parts, a further challenge is the design of the control which includes the design of the controller hardware as well as the control strategies. By applying modern structured development methods for mechatronic systems like the modified V-model [VDI 2206, 2004] the development time and the costs can be reduced whereas the quality can be improved by using a model based approach. Fundamental part of this strategy are the X-in-the-loop-simulation (XIL-simulation) methods, where all system parts, which can be pure virtual in form of models or real elements, are considered in interaction. This is done for verification and validation of the system parts and the software. By using this technique in the concrete case of the climate controller, its hardware as well as the applied control strategies can be tested and optimized in conjunction with a real time computer that is connected to the controller via appropriate interfaces. Models running on t- he real time computer simulate the air conditioning system. Thus it is possible to close the control loops in a partially virtual system. In contrast to this approach, conventional development strategies, where most control loops can be considered for the first time at the assembled system, are very time consuming and cost intensive because real test drives have to be carried out for the verification and validation processes. This is especially essential for tests under different climatic conditions like summer and winter tests. In case of the software- and hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (SIL- and HIL-simulation) for an air conditioning controller, models of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning elements (HVAC) and the passenger compartment are necessary. A main demand for the HIL-Simulation is the real time capability. Therefore it is a challenge to create simple but accurate models, that enable a fast calculation of the wanted values. In this paper both models, the HVAC and the single zone passenger compartment model and their interfaces would be presented. Further results of both models interacting in a HIL-simulation on a commercial hardware platform connected via interfaces to the climate controller would be shown","","0-7803-9047-4","","10.1109/AIM.2005.1511151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511151","","Actuators;Air conditioning;Automatic control;Control systems;Costs;Hardware;Mechatronics;Road safety;Testing;Vehicle safety","HVAC;automotive engineering;control engineering computing;digital simulation;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","HVAC;automatic air conditioning system;hardware-in-the-loop-simulation;passenger compartment model;road safety;road traffic;software-in-the-loop-simulation;vehicle climate controller","","","","1","","","","","20050926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, many studies related to the size optimization have been performed to reduce this ripple effect. This paper suggests an optimal stator shape design for the IPM motor satisfying both improved torque performance and geometrical simplification for manufacturing. To control the geometrical complexity, the concepts of the phase-field model and the level-set method are employed. The optimization problem is formulated to minimize two values: the first is the torque ripple done by adjusting the torque values at any rotor position to constant target torque, and the second is the fictitious interface energy of the phase-field model as it narrows the interfacial region.

In this context, the paper addresses the verification challenges of such complex SoC products and presents a novel verification setup suitable for the verification of complex automotive sensor interfaces integrated in a modern airbag SoC system interacting with analogue hardware with the aim to bridge the gap between ""speed' and ""accuracy"" of classical simulation of complex ICs. The verification setup includes a full event-driven simulation at system level and an FPGA with an analogue test chip prototype for the acceleration of the verification. At an early phase (before product tape-out), the setup allows not only to verify the design against its specification, but also to verify the product in its application context - in-circuit verification, helping customers to gain confidence later at the system integration process.

Therefore, the shape of the rotor blade is very important in determining the overall aerodynamic performance of the turbine. In this work, the blade element momentum theory is developed to automate the complete procedure. Three airfoils are taken for the comparative calculation of elemental power and thrust coefficient and other parameters such as circulation, torque and thrust distribution.

This work begins a series of articles describing the method of assessment and prediction of electromagnetic radiation of complex, large scale, electrical objects, such as electric cars. This paper examines the influence of a vehicle hulls on an electromagnetic radiation excited by an electrical device located inside it. For this purpose, a simplified model of vehicle electronics is taken. A set of electronic devices and their enclosures can be considered as an unintentional source of electromagnetic field. The impact of hull is analyzed from this point of view. The statistic estimation gives an account of how the hull changes the field strength, and what is the new direction of the main field pattern lobe. Typical resonant frequencies of the hull and Q-factor are considered, as well as various positions inside the car where the electronics can cause potential electromagnetic compatibility problems. Although the estimation is not absolutely precise, the simplified model gives a comprehensive assessment of the electronics emission. The goal is to find out whether the car hull and electronics inside can be still considered as an unintentional emitter, to compare the radiation characteristics with the unintentional emitter model and to know limitations of this approach. Results obtained from the analysis are used in a methodology aimed at prediction of the system-level emission on the basis of component-level emission measurements. However, they can be used in making rapid measurement and radiation prediction methods, which are required at a design and vehicle prototyping stage, etc. in software like rule-checking or expert systems.","","978-1-4673-3060-2","","10.1109/EEEIC.2013.6549529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549529","Q-factor;automotive EMC;directivity;electromagnetics;resonant frequencies","","Q-factor;automotive electronics;electromagnetic compatibility;statistical analysis","Q-factor;electrical device;electromagnetic compatibility problems;electromagnetic radiation;electronics emission;expert systems;field pattern lobe;field strength;radiated emission;radiation characteristics;radiation prediction methods;software like rule checking;statistic estimation;vehicle design process;vehicle electronics;vehicle hull","","","","0","","16","","","20130701","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These faults, originating from various interactions and especially between hardware and software, are particularly challenging to address. Our basic strategy is to divide the fault universe of the cyber-physical system in a hierarchical manner, and monitor the critical variables/signals that have impact at different levels of interactions. Diagnostic matrix is established to represent the relationship between the faults and the test outcomes (also known as fault signatures). A factorial hidden Markov model-based inference algorithm, termed dynamic multiple fault diagnosis, is used to infer the root causes based on the observed test outcomes. The proposed diagnostic strategy is validated on an electrical power generation and storage system controlled by two ECUs in an environment with CANoe/MATLAB co-simulation. Eleven faults are injected with the failures originating in actuator hardware, sensor, controller hardware, and software components (sensor faults are not considered in this paper).

We present a system to recognize the license number in the acquired image captured from a video camera. The recognition process of our system contains four major steps. First, the system tries to locate the probable position of the license plate within the acquired image by using gradient analysis and image processing. Second, our model estimates the image parameters needed to normalize the license plate and uses the cross-correlation to detect the skew of the license plate and rectify the tilt. Third, we use a template technique to recognize the characters in the license plate. Finally, we use the information gained from the previous step to analyze the probable license numbers.

Since the regenerative braking torque is proportional to the parameters such as tank pressure and engine speed, a controller is needed for the control of the regenerative braking torque generated by internal combustion engine, based on the driver preference. In this work, a nonlinear control approach based on adaptive sliding-mode control (ASMC) is employed to tackle the problem of engine torque control during regenerative mode. To this end, a novel mean value model for a recently proposed cam-based air hybrid engine is derived for the regenerative mode and employed for designing the controller. The adaptive sliding-mode controller incorporates the approximately known inverse dynamic model output of the engine as a model-base component of the controller, and an estimated uncertainty term to compensate for the unmodeled dynamics, external disturbances (e.g., gear shifting), and time-varying system parameters such as tank pressure. The robustness and performance of the controller for this particular application is investigated and compared with that of a high-gain PID controller and a smooth sliding-mode controller numerically and experimentally. The results show that the controller performs remarkably well in terms of the robustness, tracking error convergence, and disturbance attenuation. Chattering effect is also removed by utilizing the ASMC scheme.","1083-4435","","","10.1109/TMECH.2011.2129525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5752859","Adaptive sliding-mode control (ASMC);air hybrid engines;engine torque control;regenerative braking","Adaptation model;Atmospheric modeling;Engines;Manifolds;Mathematical model;Torque;Valves","adaptive control;aerospace engines;aircraft control;braking;compensation;control system synthesis;internal combustion engines;nonlinear control systems;three-term control;time-varying systems;torque control;variable structure systems;vehicle dynamics","ASMC scheme;adaptive sliding mode control;automotive industry;cam-based air hybrid vehicles;controller design;disturbance attenuation;engine speed;engine torque control;external disturbance compensation;high-gain PID controller;internal combustion engine;mean value model;nonlinear control approach;regenerative braking torque control;regenerative mode;tank pressure;time-varying system parameter compensation;tracking error convergence;unmodeled dynamic compensation","","","","1","","24","","2011-04-21","20120504","","IEEE","ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes an approach to systematically explore the design space of SW/HW mappings to determine energy-optimal deployments. It employs constraint-solving techniques for generating deployment candidates and probabilistic analyses for computing the expected energy consumption of the respective deployment.

It is very important to study and improve the braking ability of the automobile. The anti-lock braking system (ABS) is the active method of increasing the braking ability. The ABS controller is the key to ABS. The modeling and simulation of the automobile braking system can be used in designing the ABS controller. The general braking model is built by analyzing the forces on the automobile body and it is difficult to be understood. A new method which establishes the braking model is presented in this paper. When the automobile is braking, the kinetic is worn down by frictions that come from the wheels and road, the wheels and the braking block. A single wheel mathematical model is deduced with this principle. The simulation models of this braking system and ABS are established. Simulations under Matlab/ Simulink are made. The braking distances obtained by the simulation are compared with the known data. The results show that the braking model based on the kinetic energy conversion is reliable. This method can provide a new way to analyze the automobile braking process.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677741","Anti-lock braking system;Braking model;Kinetic energy","Automobiles;Friction;Kinetic energy;Kinetic theory;Mathematical model;Propulsion;Road accidents;Security;Vehicles;Wheels","automobiles;automotive engineering;brakes;braking;friction;road accidents;road traffic;vehicle dynamics;velocity control;wheels","ABS controller design;Matlab-simulink;antilock braking system;automobile braking system;fatal traffic accident;force analysis;frictions;kinetic energy conversion;overlength braking distance;road vehicles;single wheel mathematical model","","","","0","","6","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fault tolerance is an important aspect of safety. In general, fault tolerance is achieved by duplicating hardware components, a solution that is often more expensive than needed. In applications such as automotive electronics, a subset of the functionalities has to be guaranteed while others are not crucial to the safety of the operation of the vehicle. In this case, we must make sure that this subset is operational under the potential faults of the architecture. A model of computation called fault-tolerant data flow (FTDF) was recently introduced to describe at the highest level of abstraction of the design the fault tolerance requirements on the functionality of the system. Then, the problem of implementing the system efficiently on a platform consists of finding a mapping of the FTDF model on the components of the platform. A complete design flow for this kind of application requires a user-friendly graphical interface to capture the functionality of the systems with the FTDF model, algorithms for choosing an architecture optimally, (possibly automatic) code generation for the parts of the system to be implemented in software and verification tools. In this paper, we use the generic modeling environment (GME) developed at Vanderbilt University to design a graphical design capture system and to provide the infrastructure for automatic code generation. The design flow is embedded into the Metropolis environment developed at the University of California at Berkeley to provide the necessary verification and analysis framework.","","0-7695-2308-0","","10.1109/ECBS.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1409921","","Application software;Computer architecture;Embedded software;Error correction;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Feedback control;Hardware;Software design;Vehicle safety","data flow analysis;embedded systems;formal verification;graphical user interfaces;program compilers;safety-critical software;software architecture;software fault tolerance;software tools","automatic code generation;embedded software;fault-tolerant data flow modeling;generic modeling environment;real-time feedback control application;safety-critical system;user-friendly graphical interface;verification tools","","","","3","","16","","","20050418","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, the designed real-time structure integrated with CAN test-bench is described and then the model of the drivetrain is derived. Secondly, considering that the CAN-induced time-varying delays are bounded, a method to model their effects as disturbances is proposed. Then, a robust one step ahead predictive controller based on flexible control Lyapunov functions is designed, which explicitly takes into account the bounds of the disturbances caused by time-varying delays and guarantees also the input-to-state stability of the system in a non-conservative way.

But, how to build intelligent logistics management system based on intelligent computing technology has become a challenge. This paper, focusing on the function and system structure of intelligent management platform, presents the design of intelligent logistics management system based on Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic Information System (GIS), and intelligent computing. Finally, a sample model of using quantum genetic intelligent algorithm to solve transportation problem in the intelligent logistics management system is given.","","978-1-4244-7705-0","","10.1109/CINC.2010.5643898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5643898","","Quantum computing","Global Positioning System;genetic algorithms;geographic information systems;logistics data processing;quantum computing;resource allocation;supply chain management;transportation","geographic information system;global positioning system;intelligent computing technology;intelligent logistic management system;multiobjective optimization;nonlinear optimization;quantum genetic intelligent algorithm;transportation problem","","","","0","","8","","","20101122","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this SRM, the center position of the roller, which affects directly the rolling quality, is controlled by the EHA system instead of using a conventional servo hydraulic actuator (SHA). To enhance the center position control (CPC) performance, the OTMGFPID which is a combination of a main control unit, online tuning fuzzy PID controller (OTFPID), and an online tuning modified-Grey predictor (OTMGP) is designed for the EHA. The OTMGP with self tuning ability of its predictor step size based on fuzzy technique (called FPSS) is used to estimate the actual system output and to create a compensating control signal corresponding to the system perturbations, consequently, improving the control quality. The ability of using the EHA and OTMGFPID controller for the SRM with CPC is verified by simulated force control target of a press machine using EHA. Simulation results prove that the EHA as well as the proposed controller has strong potential to be applied for CPC of the SRM.","","978-1-4244-7453-0","978-89-93215-02-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669777","Center position control;Electro-Hydraulic Actuator;Fuzzy;Grey predictor;PID","Actuators;Mathematical model;Noise;Predictive models;Servomotors;Tuning","force control;fuzzy control;hydraulic actuators;position control;rollers (machinery);rolling;servomechanisms;three-term control","POSCO Corp;center position control;electro-hydraulic actuator;force control;online tuning modified-grey fuzzy PID controller;servo hydraulic actuator;steel rolling machine","","","","0","","7","","","20101217","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to have safe driving feel and comfort maneuverability on cornering, the improvement of return-to-center performance of EPS is required. This paper proposed a novel active return-to-center control strategy based on model reference fuzzy adaptive control. The reference mode of return characteristics is a frictional resistance optimized steering system model, while the adjustment mechanism of adaptive controller is designed based on fuzzy logic method. The proposed control strategy can cope with the parameter uncertainty of EPS. Moreover, the EPS return-to-center process can also be easily designed and tuned according to the customer requirements. Off-line simulation confirms the effect of proposed active return control method. By using the dSPACE rapid prototyping bypass tools, the returnability performance at low vehicle speed is verified on a vehicle test.","","978-1-61284-982-9","","10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971280","Electric power steering;Fuzzy logic control;Model reference adaptive control;Return-to-center behavior detection;Returnability","Adaptation models;Clocks;Damping;Niobium;Torque","friction;fuzzy control;model reference adaptive control systems;performance index;position control;road safety;road vehicles;steering systems;vehicle dynamics","active return control;active return-to-center control strategy;adjustment mechanism;cornering maneuverability;customer requirements;dSPACE rapid prototyping bypass tools;driving comfort;electric power steering system;frictional resistance optimized steering system model;fuzzy logic method;low vehicle speed;model reference fuzzy adaptive control;parameter uncertainty;return-to-center performance;returnability performance;safe driving feel","","","","0","","12","","","20110801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical time-triggered architecture is constituted by one or more clusters. Each cluster consists of nodes communicating with one another via a time-triggered communication protocol. Designing applications to run on such a platform is a challenging task. We address this problem by constructing a UML-based design framework which exposes the essential features of the time-triggered platforms at the UML-level and allows applications to be developed at a more abstract level before full implementation. To support preliminary functional validation, we have constructed a translator by which SystemC code can be automatically generated from UML designs. Our framework enables fast prototyping of time-triggered applications and early design validation. It also supports key design principles of TTAs, such as temporal firewalls and composability.","1052-8725","978-0-7695-3062-8","","10.1109/RTSS.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408290","","Aerospace safety;Application software;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer architecture;Protocols;Prototypes;Real time systems;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;safety-critical software;software architecture","SystemC code;UML-based design framework;safety-critical real-time applications;time-triggered applications;time-triggered architectures","","","","0","","35","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
