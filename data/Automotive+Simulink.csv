This contribution addresses this aspect by showing and discussing an approach for efficient automated transitions from digital parts of Simulink models representing heterogeneous systems to VHDL and Verilog descriptions. It describes a design flow, in which a Simulink model representing a digital part of a mixed-signal ASIC is checked and optimized for automated generation of design rule compliant and more efficient digital hardware implementations. For this purpose, modeling guidelines and optimizations were implemented and integrated into an easily usable graphical user interface. Thereby, the strategy is based on considering and optimizing the digital part with respect to the surrounding heterogeneous system. An evaluation of the presented design flow is shown by applying the flow to an automotive hardware design.","","978-1-4673-1187-8","978-1-4673-1186-1","10.1109/DDECS.2012.6219090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219090","","Application specific integrated circuits;Computational modeling;Guidelines;Hardware;Hardware design languages;Optimization;Timing","application specific integrated circuits;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design","VHDL;Verilog descriptions;automotive mixed-signal ASIC;efficient digital design;implementation-level models;simulink","","","","0","","13","","","20120618","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network of LUTs thus formed which represent the given control system is converted into a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) instance, such that a satisfying assignment corresponds to a potential counterexample (the set of quality-faults which violate the given fault-tolerance requirements) or hot-spot in the design.

Particular strengths of Simulink are rapid design and algorithm exploration. Moreover, commercial tools are available to generate embedded C or HDL code directly from a Simulink model. On the other hand, Simulink models are purely functional models and, hence, designers cannot seamlessly consider the architecture that a Simulink model is later implemented on. In particular, it is not possible to explore the different architectural alternatives and investigate the arising interactions and side-effects directly within Simulink. To benefit from Matlab/Simulink's algorithm exploration capabilities and overcome the outlined drawbacks, this work introduces a model transformation framework that converts a Simulink model to an executable specification, written in an actor-oriented modeling language. This specification then serves as the input of well-established Electronic System Level (ESL) design flows that, e. g., enables Design Space Exploration (DSE) and automatic code generation for both hardware and software. We also present a validation technique that considers the functional correctness by comparing the original Simulink model with the generated specification in a co-simulation environment. The co-simulation can also be used to evaluate the performance of implementation candidates during DSE. As case study, we present and investigate a torque vectoring application from an electric automotive vehicle.","1636-9874","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6646658","Actor-oriented Design;Code Generation;DSE;Matlab/Simulink;System-level Validation;SystemC","Computational modeling;Generators;Hardware;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers);Registers;Software packages","","","","","","0","","","","","20131028","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Moving From Federated to Integrated Architectures in Automotive: The Role of Standards, Methods and Tools","Di Natale, M.; Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A.L.","ReTiS Lab., Scuola Superiore Sant''Anna, Pisa, Italy","Proceedings of the IEEE","April 2010","2010","98","4","603","620","Cost pressure, flexibility, extensibility and the need for coping with increased functional complexity are changing the fundamental paradigms for the definition of automotive and aeronautics architectures. Traditional designs are based on the concept of a <i>Federated Architecture</i> in which integrated hardware/software components [Electronic Control Units (ECUs)] realize mostly independent or loosely interconnected functions. These components are connected by bus and cooperate by exchanging messages. This paradigm is now being replaced by the <i>Integrated Architecture</i>, - the concept comes from Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) introduced by the avionics community (see C. B. Watkins and R. Walter, ?Transitioning from federated avionics architectures to integrated modular avionics?, in Proc. 26th Digital Avionics Syst. Conf., Oct. 2007) but it is certainly general and applicable to other fields and in particular, automotive - in which software components can be supplied from multiple sources, integrated on the same hardware platform or physically distributed and possibly moved from one CPU to another without loss of functional and time correctness and providing a guaranteed level of reliability. This shift will decouple software design from the hardware platform design and provide opportunities for the optimization of the architecture configuration, increased extensibility, flexibility and modularity. However, the integration of software components in a distributed system realizing a complex functional behavior and characterized by safety, time and reliability constraints requires a much tighter control on the component model and its semantics, new methods and tools for analyzing the results of the composition, whether by simulation or formal methods, and methods for exploring the architecture solution space and optimizing the configuration. We provide a general overview of existing challenges and possible solutions to the design and analysis problem, <i>with - - special focus on the automotive domain</i>. The development of such methods and tools must necessarily consider compatibility with existing modeling languages and standards, including UML, AUTOSAR and synchronous reactive models, on which the widely used commercial products Simulink and SCADE are based.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2039550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440059","Architecture;automotive electronic system;automotive software;design methodology;design space exploration;system design","","automotive electronics;computational complexity;electronic engineering computing;reliability;software engineering","ECU;IMA;aeronautics architectures;architecture configuration;automotive architectures;cost pressure;distributed system;electronic control units;exchanging messages;extensibility;federated architectures;flexibility;functional complexity;functional correctness;fundamental paradigms;hardware components;hardware platform design;integrated architectures;integrated modular avionics;optimization;software components;synchronous reactive models;time correctness","","","","14","","70","","","20100329","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Signal perturbations such as small amounts of noise, shift, and spikes, can sometimes severely hamper the performance of the system, apart from complete failure of components and links. Finding minimal counterexamples (perturbations on the system leading to violation of fault-tolerance requirements) can be of great assistance to control system designers in understanding and adjusting the fault-tolerance behavior of the system. Fault injection is an effective method for dependability analysis of such systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of dominating sets of perturbations, and define a minimal set of counterexamples called the basis. We propose effective methods using a simulation-based fault injection technique on Simulink models for finding the basis set at an early stage of design, given the fault specification and fault-tolerance requirements. Experimental results on two different control system examples from the Simulink automotive library demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523036","Robustness analysis;embedded control systems;fault injection;minimal counterexamples;monotonicity;quality-faults;signal perturbations","","","","","","","0","","40","","2013-06-04","20140205","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this project, a team of two students built several masked Simulink blocks comprising elements of a mean value engine model (MVEM) and assembled these blocks into a blockset in the Simulink block library. The MVEM blockset was used to create a virtual engine for which an idle-speed controller was designed. An interesting aspect of this project is that neither student was from the controls option, having taken only a compulsory introductory course on system dynamics and control.

The machine proposed is a low voltage and high current structure able to develop the power requested by the application. The design procedure meets difficulties and solves them in manner of core saturation at high current and high power density. The analytical design procedure is detailed for the proposed machine. Discussing of high phase currents, a validation of the design needs to be approached, based on FEA method. The direct instantaneous torque control (DITC) is employed as the machine is addressed to automotive applications. As it is known that the torque ripples of the SRM are high when using only hysteresis control of the currents hence these will create discomfort to the driver. With DITC, the torque can be smoothened in order to obtain increased comfort of the passenger. In order to implement DITC method, a Matlab Simulink program was created to simulate the SRM, based on lookup tables containing the flux and torque variations function the current and rotor position, fetched from the FEA model of the machine. The program created this way offers the possibility of fast simulation of the machine and allows in the same time the possibility of implementing several control procedures.","","978-1-4673-2230-0","","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625176","DITC;FEA;automobile applications;switched reluctance machine (SRM)","Magnetic flux;Reluctance motors;Rotors;Stator windings;Torque","automotive engineering;control system synthesis;electric current control;finite element analysis;machine control;reluctance machines;table lookup;torque control;transport control;voltage control","DITC;FEA;Matlab Simulink program;core saturation;direct instantaneous torque control design;finite element analysis;flux variation function;high phase current position;hysteresis current control;lookup table;low voltage high current SRM;power density;rotor position;small automotive application;switched reluctance machine;torque ripple;torque variation function","","","","0","","","","","20131010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, we present a mode-invariant fault diagnosis procedure that is based on data -driven approach, and show its applicability to automotive engines. The proposed approach achieves high-diagnostic accuracy by detecting the faults as soon as they occur. It uses statistical hypothesis tests to detect faults, a wavelet-based preprocessing of the data, and pattern recognition techniques for classifying various faults in engines. We simulate the Toyota Camry 544N Engine SIMULINK model in a real-time simulator and controlled by a prototype ECU (Electronic Control Unit). The engine model is simulated under several operating conditions (pedal angle, engine speed, etc), and pre-and post-fault data is collected for eight engine faults with different severity levels, and a database of cases is created for applying the presented approach. The results demonstrate that appealing diagnostic accuracy and fault severity estimation are possible with pattern recognition-based techniques, and, in particular, with the support vector machines.","1095-323X","1-4244-0525-4","1-4244-0525-4","10.1109/AERO.2007.352874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4161651","","Artificial intelligence;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Databases;Engines;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Pattern recognition;Testing;Virtual prototyping","automobile industry;fault diagnosis;internal combustion engines;mechanical engineering computing;statistical testing","Toyota Camry 544N Engine SIMULINK model;automotive engines;effective data-driven approach;electronic control unit;mode-invariant fault diagnosis procedure;modern automotive industry;on-board diagnosis systems;pattern recognition-based procedures;realtime fault diagnosis;rule-based diagnosis procedures;smart service systems;sophisticated artificial intelligence;statistical hypothesis tests;wavelet-based preprocessing","","","","2","","26","","","20070618","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need for a more innovative and higher-level design flow that directly incorporates model simulation with hardware implementation is needed. Simulink is a well-known tool which allows designers to model a system at a high level and is ideal for certain classes of applications, such as automotive control. The complication of using such a tool for both modeling and hardware implementation is that there currently exists no tool chain to generate hardware from the basic Simulink blockset.

Systematic testing of models to achieve structural coverage such as state coverage, transition coverage or modified condition decision coverage (MCDC) helps in early defect detection. Automatic generation of test data can help in reducing the cost and improving the quality of systematic testing. Test data can be automatically generated either 1) directly from the models or 2) from the code generated from these models. In this paper we argue for and recommend the second approach. We propose generating test data from C, a formalism-independent intermediate language, as it is widely used in the embedded domain and most modeling tools have C code generators. Accurate representation of floating point number type is possible in C (that being the representation in the final executable) and there are various analysis tools that are available for C. A major challenge in using code to generate test data is scalability. To overcome this problem, we built a tool that combines available static slicing and model-checking techniques to generate test data. We conducted experiments to check if this tool can generate test data for large complex models from the automotive domain. To demonstrate formalism independence and scalability we chose industry size Statemate as well as Simulink/Stateflow models. The set up and the findings of these experiments are also presented in this paper. We successfully generated test data for code sizes as large as 50KLOC and detected several bugs in four already tested industry models thus proving the benefits of this approach.","","978-1-4673-0340-8","","10.1109/ICIT.2012.6210014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6210014","","Computational modeling;Computer languages;Mathematical model;Vehicle crash testing","automotive engineering;design engineering;formal verification;mechanical engineering computing;program compilers;program slicing;program testing","C code generators;Simulink;Stateflow;Statemate;automotive industry;bugs;floating point number type;formalism independence;formalism-independent intermediate language;industry models;large automotive models;low level requirements;model checking techniques;modeling tools;modified condition decision coverage;state coverage;static slicing;systematic model testing;test generation;transition coverage","","","","2","","34","","","20120604","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper contributes to the analysis of the functions-architecture interaction impact on the diagnosability of an embedded system, especially automotive systems. The approach we developed can be integrated into the design cycle. It has two important phases; first, the diagnosability analysis of discrete event systems, then the verification of a property set that we have defined and called the “diagnosability functional-architectural properties”. Properties verification is done in two stages: check the description of the architecture, described in AADL, and check the functions-architecture interaction, modeled in SystemC-Simulink.

This paper presents an improvement of code generation technology for SR obtained via a novel algorithm for optimizing the multitask implementation of Simulink models on single-processor platforms with limited availability of memory. Existing code generation tools require the addition of zero-order hold (ZOH) blocks, and therefore additional memory, and possibly also additional functional delays whenever there is a rate transition in the computation and communication flow. Our algorithm leverages a novel efficient encoding of the scheduling feasibility region to find the task implementation of function blocks with minimum additional functional delays within timing and memory constraints.

Simulations must now rely on scalable performance of multi-core systems rather than faster clock frequencies. Novel parallelization techniques are needed to satisfy the industrial simulation demands that are essential for the development of safety-critical systems. Simulink formalism is the industrial de facto standard, but current state-of-the-art simulation and code generation techniques fail to fully exploit the parallelism in modern multi-core systems. However, closed-loop and dynamic system simulations are very difficult to parallelize because of the loop-carried dependencies. In this paper we introduce a novel skewed pipelining technique that overcomes these difficulties and allows loop-carried Simulink applications to be executed concurrently in multi-core systems. By delaying the forwarding of values for a few iterations, we can break some data dependencies and coarsen the granularity of programs. This improves the concurrency and reduces the high cost of inter-processor communication.

The ""X"" in the X-by-wire is replaced by ""steer"", ""throttle"", and ""brake"" to represent the steer-by-wire, throttle-by-wire, and brake-by-wire systems. Common to all of these subsystems is that the operator control input device (i.e., steering column, acceleration pedal, and brake pedal) is not connected to the actuation devices mechanically. Rather, it is connected to an embedded computer which, in turn, sends the control signals to the actuation devices. Current state of art steering systems used in articulated vehicles are hydro-mechanical type systems, i.e., the steering column motion is transmitted and amplified by the main hydraulic circuit by hydro-mechanical means. This paper presents a new steer-by-wire (SBW) system which we designed, modeled, analyzed, and tested on wheel type loader construction equipment. The simulation results and tests conducted on a prototype development vehicle (a medium size wheel type loader) show very good agreement.

The choice of SRM for a starter/generator application is driven largely by the perceived reliability and fault tolerance of the machine and its electronics. An analysis of the SR generator's faults and excitation requirements is essential to utilize the full fault tolerance capability of the machine in this application. Thus, research has been undertaken to identify, analyze and simulate the various fault modes of the SR generator. This research included an investigation of the generator's excitation requirements with and without faults. The investigation makes it possible to determine the size of the excitation source required during the initial build up of the generator's output voltage and under fault conditions.

The advent of model-based design methodologies has alleviated some of the verification-related problems by making the code-generation process flow automatically from the model description. Given the relative infancy of this approach, several companies rely upon design flows based on different tools connected together by file transfer. This way of integrating tools defeats the very purpose of the methodology, introducing a high potential of errors in the transformation from one format to another and preventing formal analysis of the properties of the design. We propose to adopt a formal transformation across different tools and we give an example of this approach by linking two tools that are widely used in the automotive domain, Simulink and ASCET.

Such integration tests require large analog test benches or the use of actual equipment during system commissioning. Fully digital simulators can also be used to perform Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) integration tests to evaluate the performance of some parts of these very complex systems. This approach, in use for decades in the automotive and aerospace industries, can significantly reduce the costs, duration and risks related to the use of actual equipment to conduct integration tests. However the computational power required to conduct detailed simulation of such diverse and numerous power electronic components can only be achieved through the use of distributed parallel supercomputers, optimized for hard real-time performance with jitter in the order of a few microseconds. Such supercomputers have traditionally been built using expensive custom computer boards. This paper presents the technology and performance achieved by the eMEGAsim real-time digital simulator, which is capable of meeting these challenges through the use of standard commercial INTEL quad-core computers interconnected by DOLPHIN SCI communication fabric. The precision achieved in the simulation of a detailed power electronic model implemented with SIMULINK and SimPowerSystems, and executed in parallel with RT-LAB, will also be presented using a typical basic AES configuration. Furthermore, AES design implies the collaboration between several multidisciplinary teams using different tools to simulate all electrical, mechanical and fluid dynamic subsystems.

This is even more true for wireless sensor networks, since their nodes often provide very rudimentary debugging facilities, and sufficiently large networks for realistic analysis may be expensive to deploy. While this approach, also known as model-based design, is becoming quite standard for several domains that have similar constraints as wireless sensor networks, such as automotive electronics, there is a lack of tools for this purpose in the WSN world. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we present a framework (based on Simulink, Stateflow and Embedded Coder) in which an engineer can create sensor network components (both at the application and at the protocol level) that can be used as building blocks to model, simulate and automatically generate code for different underlying platforms and operating systems.","","978-1-4244-1777-3","978-1-4244-1776-6","10.1109/SAHCN.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557791","","Application software;Automotive electronics;Automotive engineering;Debugging;Light emitting diodes;Microelectronics;Operating systems;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Wireless sensor networks","codes;wireless sensor networks","automatic code generation;automotive electronics;model-based design;sensor network applications;wireless sensor networks","","","","6","","22","","","20080709","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of a coherent multi-dimensional model across all development phases enables model-based design to generate systems that are correct by construction. Even some commercial support is available for code generation from higher-level models. However, such code generation capabilities are usually limited to uniprocessor targets and to a limited range of operating environments. SysWeaver (previously called Time Weaver) is a model-based development tool that includes a flexible syscode generation scheme for distributed real-time systems that can be easily tailored to a wide range of target platforms. In this paper, we present our work on creating an interoperable toolchain to automatically generate complete runtime code using models. The toolchain includes a simulation tool (Matlab) and its code generator (Embedded Coder) along with SysWeaver. In this chain, the functional aspects of the system are specified in Simulink, Matlabs modeling language, and translated into a SysWeaver model to be enhanced with timing information, the target hardware model and its communication dependencies. The final runtime code is then generated, automatically integrating the functional code generated with Embedded Coder and SysWeavers syscode. This syscode includes OS interfacing and network communication code with predictable timing behavior that can be verified at design time. Experiments with multi-node targets with end-to-end timing constraints in an automotive system show that many aspects of syscode and functional code generation can be automated. To our knowledge, this is the first time that multi-node executables including communication messages, functional behaviors and para-functional properties have been automatically generated using a general platform-independent framework.","1545-3421","0-7695-2516-4","","10.1109/RTAS.2006.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613339","","Application software;Computer languages;Embedded system;Hardware;Mathematical model;Multimedia systems;Real time systems;Runtime;System testing;Timing","","","","","","14","","14","","","20060424","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we show how to model self-adaptive software using our language Mechatronic UML and how we transform a model specified in Mechatronic UML into a MATLAB/Simulink model automatically.

An analysis of the switched reluctance generator's (SRG) faults and excitation requirements is essential to utilize the full fault tolerance capability of the machine in this application. Thus, research has been undertaken to identify, analyze and simulate the various fault modes of the SRG. This research included an investigation of the generator's excitation requirements with and without faults. The investigation makes it possible to determine the size of the excitation source required during the initial build up of the generator's output voltage and under fault conditions.

Previous research focuses on the concurrent implementation of the dataflow part of SR models, including the optimization of the block-to-task mapping and communication buffer sizing. When the system also consists of blocks implementing finite state machines, as in modern modeling tools like Simulink and SCADE, the task implementation can be further optimized with respect to time and memory.

Research and industry have investigated the issue, how to derive test cases to cover test requirements within minimal time. For the automation of all activities related to testing tool support is available. Yet, one question is getting increasingly difficult: How to derive good, i.e. significant test cases, embracing requirements from an external perspective and incorporating knowledge about the internal design and architecture of the system under test (SUT). In this paper we present the use of internal dependences and implementation metrics in combination with an exterior view on the basis of requirements with the aim to profile the test model for the generation of good, i.e. significant test cases. The incorporation of different sources of knowledge of the SUT into test generation reduces the effort to determine test cases for different test goals independently while recreating the knowledge of the SUT in each test process step. We applied the method to a real implementation of automotive functionality in the thermal control unit of a German OEM, that was designed in Matlab Simulink and architectured in AUTOSAR 3.2. The existing test suites were linked with the internal dependences of the Matlab Code, as to assess the reachability of the existing test cases already on the implementation model. In a next step, model metrics were calculated for the implementation modules. They were set into relation with the test cases and code coverage. In doing so, we profiled the test cases and assessed the significance and expressiveness of the model metrics.","","","","10.1109/SIES.2013.6601492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601492","AUTOSAR;Centrality;Component-Dependency-Model;Cyclomatic Complexity;Matlab;Metrics;Simulink;Test Profiling;Thermal Control System;Usage Model","Analytical models;Complexity theory;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Measurement;Testing","automatic test software;automotive engineering;embedded systems;program testing;software architecture;software metrics","AUTOSAR 3.2;German OEM;Matlab Code;Matlab Simulink;SUT architecture;SUT design;automotive functionality;complex multiple functionality devices;component dependency models;embedded systems;implementation metrics;internal dependences;model metrics;system under test;test case determination;test case reachability;test generation;test model;test profiling;test requirements;testing tool support;thermal control unit;usage models","","","","0","","22","","","20130919","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance evaluation of a fuel cell system requires both static and dynamic model, especially for the automotive applications which involve step variations of electric load. Besides, current step variations abruptly change the fuel cell voltage causing a non-linear behavior. In this case, a parallel supercapacitor becomes an important element to provide energy during transients. Fuel cell dynamic models presented in literature adopt chemical-physic-electrical parameters that are not usually provided by factories. In this paper, we concern the implementation of dynamic fuel cell model during step current transients from the electrical point of view. The model is used to evaluate the transient performance of the whole system, i.e. fuel cell and supercapacitor, by means of simulation software SIMULINK.

The handling capability of the current 14V DC system is getting very close to reaching the limits. To meet the new growing electrical power demands with minimum fuel consumption and minimum environmental effects, the automobile industry is looking into increasing the present voltage threefold, from 14V to 42V for future cars. A shift towards a 42V system will cut the current of the vehicle by a factor of three. With the lower current, the size and cost of power semiconductors can be reduced, allowing for their use in applications that could not use semiconductors before. In this paper, a detailed mathematical model for a 3-phase, 4kW and 42V Lundell alternator average electrical equivalent circuit will be presented along with the DC/DC converter based architectures for dual-voltage systems.

The so-called RT-Events library is an innovative toolbox that can be used with the Simulink<sup>TM</sup> graphical software and that solves the following two problems encountered in the simulations of event-based systems: (1) time consuming variable-step algorithms; and (2) inaccurate real-time simulations with fixed-step algorithms. One important application of the new RT-Events toolbox is its capability to effectively simulate automotive systems as real-time, hardware-in-the-loop systems.

It is a low frequency and self-excited vibration that is often generated before and after the wiper reverses direction. This leads to poor visibility and an annoying sound to the driver and passengers. This paper intends to propose a control technique that is capable of reducing chatter noise and vibration in the automotive windshield wiper system. In doing so, an existing two-dimensional mathematical model of a wiper system is adopted. MATLAB Simulink is then used to simulate vibration response of the wiper. The simulated results are then verified by those obtained in the experiment. With the verified model, a control strategy, namely, input shaping is introduced. It is found that input shaping technique can reduce vibration level by approximately 30 percents over the model without control scheme.","","978-1-4244-2327-9","978-1-4244-2328-6","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4631929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631929","","Acoustic noise;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Low-frequency noise;Mathematical model;Noise generators;Noise reduction;Noise shaping;Shape control;Vibration control","","","","","","0","","12","","","20080926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Validation and Verification (V&V) activities must be performed on models and on the final product to check whether they match the initial requirements. Results of design and V&V activities must be able to impact traceability information. We thus propose DARWIN4REQ, a metamodel for requirement traceability, based on three independent flows (requirement model, solution model and V&V model). The new metamodel establishes a link between these flows and affords full traceability of requirements, including those set for heterogeneous models. This paper presents the DARWIN4REQ metamodel and its use in the context of heterogeneous models for requirements modeling, design and V&V.

Traditional design methodologies involve writing a text specification and implementing algorithms in C. However, algorithms cannot be verified without hardware. This approach leaves the engineer in the unenviable position of waiting for the last piece of hardware to arrive to enable them to test their system.

The battery temperature variation affects the remaining energy capacity, which in addition influences the remaining driving range of EV. An accurate range estimation method must take battery temperature rise into account, since the charge and discharge process leads to internal heat generation. In order to determine the battery temperature rise, we built a three-dimensional electrochemical-thermal model for a prismatic lithium-iron-phosphate/graphite cell, and calibrated its heat-transferring parameters. The accuracy of the 3-D model was verified by a series of discharge experiment, with the estimation error less than 1°C. Then a driving range estimation model was design for this battery on a pure electric vehicle. When considering or not-considering the battery temperature increase, a significant driving range estimation difference was found in Matlab/Simulink simulation, showing the importance of battery temperature prediction.","","","","10.1109/VPPC.2013.6671721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671721","","","battery powered vehicles;calibration;estimation theory;graphite;heat transfer;iron compounds;lithium compounds;secondary cells","EV driving range estimation method;LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-C;Matlab-Simulink simulation;battery temperature variation;calibration;electric vehicle;heat-transferring parameter;internal heat generation;lithium-ion battery;prismatic lithium-iron-phosphate-graphite cell;series of discharge experiment;three-dimensional electrochemical-thermal model","","","","0","","","","","20131121","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

At first, a ten-DOF whole vehicle dynamic model was developed based on Matlab/Simulink, proper passive air suspensions were chosen to replace the original rear leaf suspensions.

In addition, the scheduling policies and parameters on both the ECUs and the communication buses over which they communicate also need to be specified. These policies and parameters are computed from high-level timing and control performance constraints. The proposed tutorial will cover different aspects of this design flow, with a focus on timing and schedulability problems. After reviewing the basic concepts of worst-case execution time analysis and schedulability analysis, we will discuss the differences between meeting timing constraints (as in classical real-time systems) and meeting control performance constraints (e.g., stability, steady and transient state performance). We will then describe various control performance related schedulability analysis techniques and how they may be tied to model-based software development. Finally, we will discuss various schedule synthesis techniques, both for ECUs as well as for communication protocols like FlexRay, so that control performance constraints specified at the model-level may be satisfied.

As a result, no phase-locked loop (PLL) is needed. Moreover, a third operation mode, i.e. the droop control mode (or the D-mode in short), is introduced to the operation of STATCOM, in addition to the conventional voltage regulation mode (or the V -mode in short) and the direct Q control mode (or the Q-mode in short).

The parameters of the key components in its drivetrain such as hydraulic pump/motors, accumulators, etc. determine the overall efficiency and performance of the vehicle. To optimize the matching of a WDHHV's components, the adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm (ASAGA) was adopted. According to different optimization objectives, the parameters were calculated and imported into the corresponding Simulink model to simulate the characters. The comparison between the results calculated by ASAGA and those by the traditional engineering test method proves that ASAGA enhances the overall searching speed and capability effectively, and is thus a better method for the optimization of the vehicle drivetrain's parameters.","","978-1-4244-2692-8","978-1-4244-2693-5","10.1109/ICMA.2009.5244986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5244986","adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm;hydrostatic secondary regulation;optimization matching;wheel drive hydraulic hybrid vehicle","Automotive engineering;Fuels;Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Simulated annealing;Stability;Testing;Traction motors;Vehicle driving;Wheels","genetic algorithms;hydraulic control equipment;hydraulic drives;mechatronics;road vehicles;simulated annealing","active stability;adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm;drivetrain;fuel consumption;hydrostatic secondary regulation;optimization matching;traction performance;wheel drive hydraulic hybrid vehicle components","","","","0","","11","","","20090918","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional sensorless approaches being on the basis of d-q vector control, neither complex computation tasks nor external precise current sensors are necessary. Therefore, it is suitable for low cost implementation of variable speed drives.

Test case generation constitutes a critical activity that is cost-intensive, time-consuming and error-prone when done manually. Hence, an automation of this process is required. One automation approach is search-based testing for which the task of generating test data is transformed into an optimization problem which is solved using metaheuristic search techniques. However, only little work has been done so far applying search-based testing techniques to continuous functional models, such as SIMULINK STATEFLOW models. This paper presents the current state of my thesis developing a new approach for automatically generating continuous test data sets achieving high structural model coverage for SIMULINK models containing STATEFLOW diagrams using search-based testing. The expected contribution of this work is to demonstrate how search-based testing techniques can be applied successfully to continuous functional models and how to cope with the arising problems such as generating and optimizing continuous signals, covering structural model elements and dealing with the complexity of the models.","","978-1-4244-3495-4","","10.1109/ICSE-COMPANION.2009.5071030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071030","","Automatic testing;Automation;Automotive engineering;Communication industry;Embedded software;Embedded system;Signal generators;Signal processing;Software testing;System testing","optimisation;program testing;systems analysis","Simulink models;Stateflow diagrams;model-based software design;optimization problem;search-based testing;systematic model testing;test case generation","","","","2","","8","","","20090612","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among vector control drives, indirect rotor-flux-oriented control (IRFOC) is one of the most popular and tested options, whose main weaknesses are the dependence on motor parameters and the low-speed behaviour. Parameter values change due to several reasons, such as thermal, saturation or deep-bar effect. Saturation can be avoided by controlling the flux, and the other effects are taken into account. A thermal model that focuses on obtaining stator and rotor representative temperatures is selected. Concerning the deep-bar effect, an approximate solution to a previously developed one is presented which shows a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity. In order to obtain a better behaviour in the low speed region, a speed estimator is built so that not only the dq electrical equations are considered, but also the mechanical one. It allows considering the static friction that is not properly monitored by the current measurements when their peak value is low. The proposed design includes motor overcurrent protection and its validity and usefulness is experimentally tested on a TMS320C31 DSP from the Simulink/Matlab environment.","","0-7803-8304-4","","10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1571847","Vector control;deepbar effect;parameter estimation","Aerospace control;Aerospace testing;Automotive engineering;Induction motors;Machine vector control;Mathematical model;Parameter estimation;Rotors;Sensorless control;Stators","control engineering computing;electric machine analysis computing;induction motor drives;machine vector control;motor protection;overcurrent protection;parameter estimation;rotors;stators","Simulink-Matlab environment;TMS320C31 DSP;deep-bar effect;deep-bar effects;indirect rotor-flux-oriented control;induction motor;motor overcurrent protection;online parameter estimation;position sensors;sensorless drive control;static friction;thermal effects;vector control drives","","","","0","","10","","","20060110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, in a model-based design flow, the results of the model validation and verification are retained only if the code implementation preserves the semantic properties of interest. Since AUTOSAR does not support the modeling of the internal behavior of runnables, the most likely candidate for the development of the functions behavior is Simulink, which is based on a Synchronous Reactive semantics. Commercial code generation tools offer solutions for preserving the signal flows exchanged among model blocks allocated to the same core, but do not scale to multicore systems.

We introduce ESC-QC notations through an example from automotive requirements and then describe the formal syntax and semantics. Besides being useful for formal documentation and analysis of system requirements, ESC-QC specifications can be translated into monitors and used for run-time verification of designs. In automotive systems Simulink/Stateflow (SL/SF) is widely used for design of control systems. We have developed an algorithm for automatic synthesis of SL/SF monitors from ESC-QC specifications.

In this system, the wheel speed signal produced by simulation was converted into another signal which the ABS ECU can distinguish. According to the signal, automobile braking pressure is controlled by the ABS ECU. The pressure signal is adopted by the simulation computer and transmitted to the simulation model to calculate some parameters, such as deceleration and instantaneous wheel speed. Then the instantaneous wheel speed is transmitted to the ABS ECU. The virtual road conditions could be changed by setting different parameters, which would cause the change of the control strategy. Then the performance of the braking system in different road conditions could be researched and evaluated. The results show that the proposed semi-physical evaluation system can be used to effectively test and evaluate the performance of braking system.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677604","ABS;Semi-Physical Simulation;Simulink;evaluation system","Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Equations;Propulsion;Road vehicles;Testing;Tires;Torque;Vehicle dynamics;Wheels","automobiles;braking;mechanical engineering computing","ABS;antilock braking system;automobile braking pressure;semiphysical simulation evaluation system;virtual road conditions","","","","0","","8","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Latest trends in designing intelligent building energy management systems (IBEMS) integrate a man machine interface that could store the user's preferences and adapt the control strategy accordingly. The objective of the present paper is to present the advantages of the fuzzy control techniques together with a man machine interface based on a smart card terminal in satisfying the user preferences.

For these reasons, embedded systems have became more complicated and require a lot of time for designing. Model-based programming has came into the spotlight in the embedded system industry that demands short time-to-market, especially in the automotive industry. Model-based programming allows the developer to design and implement the system easily by using blocks that provide automatic code-generation function. In addition, blocks provide the simulation function at the design and implementation step. Among the model-based programming's features, simulation is of greatest importance because accurate simulation can reduce cost, time and effort. Most simulators just estimate that the model works correctly without consideration of hardware characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes the new hybrid-block that can simulate not only functions of the model, but also features of hardware. We develop the 16-bit embedded system for the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in the automotive system and implement the hybrid-blocks that have two modes of automatic code-generation and simulation. The application model can be constructed by using the hybrid-block. In automatic code-generation mode, models can generate complete C program code for a specific platform without any modification. In simulation mode, the model can be simulated by considering the hardware and software characteristics of the model. In this paper, consequence of simulation with real-value in the 16-bit embedded system is compared.","","978-89-950038-6-2","978-89-950038-6-2","10.1109/ICCAS.2007.4406575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406575","Automatic code-generation;ECU;Embedded system;Model-based programming;Simulation","Application software;Automatic control;Automatic programming;Automotive engineering;Costs;Embedded system;Functional programming;Hardware;Mathematical model;Time to market","automatic programming;automobile industry;automotive electronics;digital simulation;embedded systems;program compilers","Matlab;Simulink;automatic code generation function;automotive industry;automotive system;complete C program code;electronic control unit;embedded systems;hardware characteristics;model-based programming","","","","0","","11","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The passive suspension system cannot reduce the vibrations which are transmitted from the road disturbances to the frame which affect the ride comfort and vehicle stability. The magnitude of these vibrations can be reduced by using ABFNN based an active suspension system. The ABFNN has ability to approximate the nonlinearity of the vehicle. By using B-spline membership function in the fuzzy neural network the approximation ability of the network is increased. The shape of B-spline membership function is adjusted self adaptively by changing control points during learning process. B-spline membership functions give a structure for choosing the shape of the fuzzy sets. The update parameters of ABFNN are trained by gradient-based technique that may fall into local minima during the learning process.

In early design phases, even when there is still uncertainty about the feasibility of the requirements, valuable information can be gained from models that describe the expected usage and the desired system reaction. The generation of test cases from these models indicates the feasibility of the intended solution and helps to identify scenarios for which the realization is hardly feasible or the intended system behavior is not properly defined. In this paper we present the formalization of requirements by models to simulate the expected field usage of a system. These so called usage models can be enriched by information about the desired system reaction. Thus, they are the basis for all subsequent testing activities: First, they can be used to verify the first implementation models and design decisions w.r.t. the fulfillment of requirements and second, test cases can be derived in a random or statistic manner. The generation can be controlled with operational profiles that describe different classes of field usage. We have applied our approach at a large German car manufacturer in the early development phase of active safety functionalities. Test cases were generated from the usage models to assess the implementation models in MATLAB/Simulink. The parametrization of the systems could be optimized and a faulty transition in the implementation models was revealed.

With this method, the real ECU is place in a simulative environment for the software under test. The software runs on the real target hardware. The basic idea with dasiaSoftware-in-the-Looppsila(SIL) is the same, except that all runs on standard PC hardware. [1] Both for HIL and SIL many simulated models for automotive industry are made in MATLAB/Simulink. A way how to put ECU's software into MATLAB/Simulink in order to have a complete testing environment will reduce considerably the testing costs and time to market. To have a unitary view both for HIL and SIL we must use the same approach. To keep the consistency we should use the same measurement and application tool, in our case CANApe. This will be done using XCP protocol based on Ethernet TCP/IP transport layer. [2] The entire ECU's software will be wrapped into a MATLAB/Simulink S-Function.

Resolvers and high-resolution encoders provide excellent measurement accuracy. However, market competition has forced designers to look into less expensive solutions that have relatively large measurement errors. This paper studies the effect of position sensor measurement errors on torque ripple performance of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The low cost sensor system considered here has a dual Hall sensor IC and a magnet wheel. The effect of relatively poor resolution and magnet wheel tolerance are simulated with Simulink models. With the same motor and controller model, a high performance resolver is also simulated. The simulation results of both types of sensor are compared. The torque ripple performance degradation due to lower cost sensor is identified. The results show an acceptable torque ripple with the lower cost sensor. A DSP based motor controller is built and tested with the dual Hall sensing system. The test results show a torque ripple of about 2 % for the complete motor drive with Hall position sensor.

The estimation algorithm employed is an observer for a new extended system model, in which the steering angle and its derivative are viewed as two state variables. Then, the lateral displacements estimation and the control algorithm are investigated. An accurate and real-time estimation of the lateral displacements with respect to the road can be accomplished in such a control system. The closed loop controller is used as a compensator to control the lateral dynamics of the vehicle. The vehicle dynamic and control system are simulated with Matlab Simulink.

Multiple control applications - like cruise control, brake control, etc. - are specified as Simulink/Stateflow models, from which code is generated and mapped onto the different ECUs. In addition, scheduling policies and parameters, both for the ECUs and the buses, need to be specified. Code generation/optimization from the Simulink/Stateflow models, task partitioning and mapping decisions, as well as the parameters chosen for the schedulers - all of these impact the execution times and timing behaviour of the control tasks and control messages. These in turn affect control performance, such as stability and steady-/transient-state behaviour. This paper discusses different aspects of this multi-layered design flow and the associated research challenges. The emphasis is on model-based code generation, analysis, testing and verification of control software for automotive architectures, as well as on architecture or platform configuration to ensure that the required control performance requirements are satisfied.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064534","Automotive Control Systems;Model-based code generation;Model-based testing;verification","Indium phosphide;Optimization;Software;Visualization","peripheral interfaces;program compilers;program testing;program verification;traffic control","CAN bus;FlexRay;Simulink model;Stateflow model;automotive architecture;automotive control software cross-layer analysis;automotive control software testing;automotive control software verification;code optimization;electronic control unit;mapping decision;message control;model-based code generation;multilayered design flow;scheduling policy;transient-state behaviour","","","","0","","","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model includes a direct rotor flux oriented controlled (DFOC) induction machine drive, which is operated in both motoring and generating modes (i.e. starter and alternator modes). During the starting, the induction machine cranks the engine with high starting torque against the engine restoring torque. When the speed of the engine is increased to a certain value that ensures the complete starting of the engine, the control system changes the induction machine into the generation mode. In the generation mode, the power is input to the machine from the automotive engine which is modeled as an infinite source of torque. The DC bus voltage is maintained at 42 V. The operating speed of the modeled ISA can be varied, with field weakening starting at the machine base speed. The model successfully allows many operational aspects of the proposed ISA to be predicted, in particular the regulated DC voltage developed by the ISA during conditions of load dump step speed increase.","","7-5605-1869-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377000","","","alternators;asynchronous generators;automobiles;electric drives;electric machine analysis computing;machine vector control;mathematics computing;rotors;starting;torque","42 V;DC bus voltage regulation;Matlab-Simulink model;automobiles;automotive engine;automotive engine speed;direct rotor flux oriented control;dynamic model;engine restoring torque;induction generator;induction machine cranks;induction machine drive;integrated starter alternator","","","","1","","","","","20050502","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the development process for these has by and large remained a manual, document led process. This inevitably leads to delays, interpretation errors and omissions which are often not identified until late in the process - when it is time consuming and expensive to change the design. Furthermore, the design has to be verified and validated from requirements through to the final implementation. Manual processes make this a laborious and thankless task. By utilising the powerful and flexible model based design process allowed by MATLABreg & Simulinkreg, this paper will show how complex and innovative new working methods can be developed to improve the design cycle. These will allow rapid modeling and testing of algorithms, before committing to the expense of development for the final hardware platform, and the resulting cost benefits achieved by avoiding late changes to the design.

However the efficient development of reliable control software is difficult. We have proposed to introduce a “model-based design” process using MATLAB/Simulink, established in the automotive and aerospace fields, to the development of power electronics systems. However, it was difficult in the past because calculating switching circuit as the plant model is difficult in MATLAB/Simulink due to the socalled stiff equation problem. Thus, in this study, we have developed a simulation environment in which the standard model-based design tool, MATLAB/Simulink, and the simulation engine for power switching circuits, SCALE, work cooperatively. SCALE was originally developed to solve stiff equation and efficiently simulate power switching circuits. This software environment enables us to design control algorithms with intuitive block diagram expression and test them in actual hardware, without writing a C program. Furthermore to improve this environment, a mechanism that handles the multiple sample rates was introduced. Smart energy systems that use several controllers with different sampling rates can be simulated in the proposed environment. Thus, we can develop control software for smart energy systems in a timely and cost effective manner.","","978-1-4673-2328-4","978-1-4673-2329-1","10.1109/ICRERA.2012.6477477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477477","control;model-based design;simulation;software","Batteries;Computational modeling;Control systems;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Software packages","C language;control engineering computing;power electronics;power engineering computing;smart power grids;switching circuits;switching convertors","C program;Matlab-Simulink;SCALE;aerospace fields;automotive fields;block diagram expression;complex control software;control algorithms design;multisample-rate controllers;power converters;power electronics systems;power switching circuits;reliable control software;sampling rates;simulation environment;smart energy applications;standard model-based design tool;stiff equation problem","","","","0","","7","","","20130314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition a BESS could offer ancillary support to the network including balancing services as well as deferring network asset upgrade, with ensuing financial advantages. Until now the cost of providing a BESS has been prohibitive except for the most isolated and essential supply. The main contribution of this paper will be to demonstrate that afterlife electric vehicle (EV) batteries can be used in BESS for the provision of such services with particular emphasis on peak shaving and upgrade deferral. The size of the BESS is calculated using a simulation based on a LV load profile and the effect on voltage is modelled and displayed graphically.

Finally, a hardware-inloop simulation based on CANoe and CANalyzer is conducted for the testing and evaluation of the VCU. The result shows that the real-time multi-data fusion algorithm produces a good estimation of the road grade and vehicle mass with an error of 5%, and the convergence and steady-state error meet the need of real vehicle applications.","","","","10.1109/VPPC.2013.6671743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671743","","","Global Positioning System;automobiles;battery powered vehicles;brakes;braking;controller area networks;inertial navigation;program compilers;reduced instruction set computing;road traffic control;sensor fusion;wheels","4-wheel drive electric mini car;4WD electric vehicle;CANalyzer;CANoe;GPS;INS;MPC561 digital core;Simulink;VCU;automatic code generation technology;braking energy recovery;convergence;global positioning system;hardware in loop simulation;inertial navigation system;multienergy power system;multisensor data fusion;new energy vehicle;power distribution;road grade estimation algorithm;steady-state error;vehicle control unit;vehicle mass estimation algorithm;vehicle test","","","","0","","","","","20131121","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is very important to study and improve the braking ability of the automobile. The anti-lock braking system (ABS) is the active method of increasing the braking ability. The ABS controller is the key to ABS. The modeling and simulation of the automobile braking system can be used in designing the ABS controller. The general braking model is built by analyzing the forces on the automobile body and it is difficult to be understood. A new method which establishes the braking model is presented in this paper. When the automobile is braking, the kinetic is worn down by frictions that come from the wheels and road, the wheels and the braking block. A single wheel mathematical model is deduced with this principle. The simulation models of this braking system and ABS are established. Simulations under Matlab/ Simulink are made. The braking distances obtained by the simulation are compared with the known data. The results show that the braking model based on the kinetic energy conversion is reliable. This method can provide a new way to analyze the automobile braking process.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677741","Anti-lock braking system;Braking model;Kinetic energy","Automobiles;Friction;Kinetic energy;Kinetic theory;Mathematical model;Propulsion;Road accidents;Security;Vehicles;Wheels","automobiles;automotive engineering;brakes;braking;friction;road accidents;road traffic;vehicle dynamics;velocity control;wheels","ABS controller design;Matlab-simulink;antilock braking system;automobile braking system;fatal traffic accident;force analysis;frictions;kinetic energy conversion;overlength braking distance;road vehicles;single wheel mathematical model","","","","0","","6","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based on partial-state feedback controller is used to optimize the roll stability of the vehicle. The control objective for optimizing roll stability is to be reducing the lateral load transfer rate while keeping the suspension angle less than the maximum allowable angle. The simulation result shows that the LQR controller is effective in the active roll stability control of the heavy tractor-semitrailer.","","978-0-7695-3614-9","","10.1109/PACCS.2009.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232398","Tractor-semitrailer;lateral load transfer;linear quadratic regulator;roll stability","Automotive engineering;Axles;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Design engineering;Mathematical model;Motion control;Road accidents;Stability;Vehicle dynamics","feedback;linear quadratic control;stability;traction;vehicle dynamics","LQR controller;Matlab-Simulink;control objective;dynamic modeling;heavy tractor-semitrailer;lateral load transfer rate;linear quadratic regulator;partial-state feedback controller;roll control;yaw-roll stability","","","","0","","10","","","20090904","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
