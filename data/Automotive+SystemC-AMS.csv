"Holistic modeling of embedded systems with multi-discipline feedback: Application to a Precollision Mitigation Braking System","Leveque, A.; Pecheux, F.; Louerat, M.; Aboushady, H.; Cenni, F.; Scotti, S.; Massouri, A.; Clavier, L.","LIP6, Univ.

A Precollision Mitigation Braking System (PMBS) is used as a pragmatic case study to validate the whole approach. The component models presented (60 GHz communication channel, QPSK RF transceiver, CMOS video sensor, digital microcontroller, simplified car kinetic engine) are written in SystemC and its analog Mixed-Signal extensions, SystemC-AMS, and belong to five distinct yet highly interwoven disciplines: newtonian mechanics, op to-electronics, analog RF, digital and embedded software. The paper clearly exhibits the complex multi-discipline feed- back loop of this automotive application and the related model composability issues. Using the opto-electrical stimulus and the received RF inter-vehicle data, a car is able to exploit its environmental data to autonomously adjust its own velocity. This adjustment impacts the physical environment that in turns modifies the RF communication conditions. Results show that this holistic first-order virtual prototype can be advantageously used to jointly develop the final embedded software and to refine any of its hardware component part.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176567","","Embedded software;Kinetic theory;Radio frequency;Transceivers;Vehicles;Wireless sensor networks","automotive engineering;braking;embedded systems;mechanical engineering computing;mobile communication;optoelectronic devices;quadrature phase shift keying;radio transceivers;wireless sensor networks","RF inter-vehicle data;SystemC;SystemC-AMS;analog RF;analog mixed-signal extensions;automotive application;complex multidiscipline feedback loops;component models;composability issues;cyber-physical systems;digital software;embedded software;embedded systems;heterogeneous system;holistic first-order virtual prototype;holistic modeling;newtonian mechanics;opto-electrical stimulus;opto-electronics;precollision mitigation braking system;wireless sensor network nodes","","","","0","","","","","20120403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus on short circuit events in an automotive environment where high power dissipation and thermal stress severely affect device reliability. For accurate temperature calculation, a non-linear thermal network including coupling between power transistor channels is used. A digital strategy for over current limitation, short circuit detection and over-temperature shutdown is modeled using SystemC-AMS and verified experimentally using a hardware-in-the-loop system.","","978-1-4244-5358-0","","10.1109/BMAS.2009.5338890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5338890","","Automotive engineering;Circuit simulation;Digital control;MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Power dissipation;Power system modeling;Power system protection;Power system reliability;Thermal stresses","analogue integrated circuits;automotive electronics;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;power integrated circuits;switches;thermal stresses","SystemC-AMS;analog driving circuitry;current limitation;device reliability;digital controller;digital protection concept verification;hardware-in-the-loop system;nonlinear thermal network;over-temperature shutdown;power MOSFET;power dissipation;power transistor channels;short circuit detection;smart power switches;system level modeling;thermal stress","","","","1","","12","","","20091120","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The tutorial will present the novel modeling language for analog and mixed-signal functions to facilitate design and modeling of telecommunications and automotive applications at various levels of abstraction. The concepts beyond the defined language constructs will be presented. A simple design example will illustrate how these new features facilitate a design refinement methodology for functional modeling, architecture exploration and virtual prototyping of embedded analog and mixed-signal systems.","","978-1-4244-4940-8","978-1-4244-4941-5","10.1109/SOCCON.2009.5397994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5397994","","Atmospheric measurements;Damping;Gases;Micromechanical devices;Packaging;Q factor;Q measurement;Resonance;Technological innovation;Wafer scale integration","embedded systems;hardware description languages;integrated circuit modelling;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;virtual prototyping","SystemC AMS DRAFT standard;SystemC AMS extension;architecture exploration;automotive applications;design refinement methodology;embedded analog/mixed signal systems;functional modeling;language constructs;telecommunications applications;virtual prototyping","","","","2","","","","","20100122","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Using SystemC AMS for heterogeneous systems modelling at TIER-1 level","Arndt, Thomas; Uhle, Thomas; Einwich, Karsten; Neumann, Ingmar","Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Design Automation Division, Zeunerstr. 38, 01069 Dresden, Germany","Specification & Design Languages (FDL 2010), 2010 Forum on","14-16 Sept. 2010","2010","","","1","6","For the design of cyber-physical systems in the automotive domain we have to take more and more the complete value chain from the semiconductor (TIER-2) via the component (TIER-1) up to the automobile manufacturer (OEM) into account. The current requirements for safety, comfort and energy efficiency, and, above all, the rising cost pressure calls for system designs covering different domains (e.g., mechanics, analogue, and digital electronics) as well as software being tightly coupled. Due to this increasing complexity there is an indispensable need for virtual prototypes. However, the creation of such TIER-1 designs bares some challenges, for example simulation performance, modelling effort, and the assembly of models from different vendors. This paper discusses various ways for creating models for a system simulation at TIER-1 level, such as the anti-lock braking system. It is shown, how to combine these methodologies and how to integrate them into a typical TIER-1 design environment.","","","","10.1049/ic.2010.0157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5775137","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20110527","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"
