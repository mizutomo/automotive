Accordingly, the size and complexity of ECU software also increased, and these give rise to various challenges to automotive software engineers. They need a new approach and tools to meet these challenges. Model-Based development is a choice. This paper presents a model-based design approach for the development of AMT (Automated Manual Transmission) ECU software using UML-RT language in automotive domain. UML-RT is a modeling language tailored to the demands of real-time software. The paper shows the methods and process on modeling functional and architectural model using UML-RT key diagram. Conclusions are drawn on how these models helps the different developers visualize, construct, and discuss together the structure and behavior of software's architecture.","","978-1-4244-7324-3","978-89-88678-22-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542946","ECU Software;Model-Based;UML-RT;automotive engineering;software modeling","Actuators;Application software;Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Driver circuits;Embedded software;Gears;Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;Vehicles","","","","","","0","","11","","","20100809","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Original equipment manufacturers have increasingly requested SPICE certifications from their suppliers in order to effectively evaluate the development processes and identify reliable partners. To support organizations in their software process improvement effort, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed the IDEAL model. This guide is, however, influenced by the SEI's work on CMM and based on the experiences with very large organizations. The goal of this paper is to examine the suitability of the IDEAL model for the implementation of Automotive SPICE at a medium-sized R&D department. Preliminary results from an action research study at a global systems engineering company are discussed. The data indicate that adjustments are especially needed with regard to the factors participation and communication. Also, informal networks between companies, early decision-making and usability are shown to play an important role and might be added to the model.","","978-1-4673-1823-5","","10.1109/CHASE.2012.6223026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223026","Automotive-SPICE;IDEAL-Model;improvement models;software process improvement","Automotive engineering;Companies;IEC standards;ISO standards;SPICE","Capability Maturity Model;automotive engineering;decision making;research and development;software standards","CMM;IDEAL software process improvement model;ISO/IEC 15504;SEI;SPICE certifications;Software Engineering Institute;automotive SPICE Implementation;automotive industry;domain-specific model;early decision making;global systems engineering company;informal networks;medium-sized R&D department","","","","0","","17","","","20120625","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model is implemented as a reasoning framework in the ArchE architecture expert system developed jointly with the Software Engineering Institute. To ensure continuous availability many automotive electronic control units (ECUs) employ an external watchdog running on a separate CPU to monitor the software running on the ECU. If the ECU has a failure that causes interruption of its functionality, the watchdog can detect this and reset the ECU to restore correct operation. The availability model can automatically evaluate the effectiveness of a watchdog design in the software architecture and can propose improvements to achieve better availability before implementation decisions are made. The model enables a quantitative analysis of system availability that can better guide software architecture and dependability design decisions and potentially reduce implementation and testing effort.","","0-7695-2968-2","","10.1109/SEAS.2007.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228596","","Automatic control;Automotive electronics;Automotive engineering;Availability;Computer architecture;Condition monitoring;Expert systems;Software architecture;Software design;Software engineering","automotive electronics;expert systems;inference mechanisms;software architecture","ArchE architecture expert system;Software Engineering Institute;automotive electronic control units;automotive software architectures;reasoning framework","","","","0","","5","","","20070611","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we extend the EAST-ADL2 language with timed automata and signal matrix to form a multiview requirement modeling language. Furthermore, we use a theory of 4-variable requirement model to link these three formalisms together to form a consistent and complete understanding of automotive software requirements. The proposed modeling framework takes the advantages that: (1) it allows us to separate the whole requirements into three complementary aspects: structure, timing behavior and communication signals, which combined together to form a complete and consistent software requirements; (2) it builds numerous formal relationships, which can be checked furthermore for requirement verifications.","","978-1-4244-7860-6","","10.1109/INDUSIS.2010.5565769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5565769","Architecture description language;Automotive software;Model-driven development;Requirement modeling;Timed automata","Actuators;Clocks;Driver circuits;Hardware;Medical services;Monitoring;Prototypes","automobiles;automotive electronics;finite state machines;simulation languages;software engineering;traffic engineering computing","4-variable requirement model;ECU development;automotive electronic systems;automotive software modeling requirement;communication signals;electronic control unit;extended EAST-ADL2 architecture description language;finite state machine;multiview requirement modeling language;signal matrix;system structures;timed automata","","","","0","","8","","","20100907","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the executable system model serves as an interface description for module designers, which eases the problem of system integration.

The VHILS concept was applied to an automotive adaptive cruise control system (ACCS), and driver maneuvering, vehicle dynamics, micro controller operation and CAN communication were modeled. The modeling efficiency of the serial data communication and the data exchange between the CAN model and the multi-domain simulation were identified as the primarily causes of longer computational time.

This high degree of distribution of hard- and software components is a key contributor to the difficulty of failure management in vehicle. This paper addresses comprehensive failure management, starting from domain models for logical and deployment models of automotive software. These models capture interaction patterns as a critical part of both logical and deployment architectures, introducing failure detection and mitigation as ""wrapper"" services to ""unmanaged services"", i.e. services without failure management. We show how these models can be embedded into an interaction-centric development process, which captures failure management information across development phases.

Embedded systems have to rely on high quality hardware as well as high quality software. Software development for embedded systems is often a complex undertaking and fundamentally different from that of non-embedded systems. Complexity arises from the need to co-design and create software at low-level of abstraction that also interacts closely with hardware with strong emphasis on dependability and mission-critical real-time constraints. Compared to traditional software development, the increasing complexity also exacerbates challenges in embedded software development processes, such as troubles in achieving sufficient product quality and timely delivery. In order to tackle these challenges in embedded software development, industry needs to apply software engineering technologies that are appropriate for specific situations. The 2nd International Workshop on Software Engineering for Embedded Systems (SEES 2012) Workshop, in conjunction with International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2012) in Zurich, Switzerland, aims to provide researchers and practitioners an international forum to discuss the issues, challenges in adopting software engineering methods for embedded systems development. Further, the overall goal of the workshop is to identify the research opportunities and develop a research agenda to tackle the challenges. The workshop program committee selected nine papers from eighteen submissions for the workshop proceedings. They cover several interesting software-related aspects of embedded systems development, such as software-system architecture, development process, component- and model-based development, and automotive development. The diversity of topics and the decent number of submissions indicate what a vibrant community there is in the intersection of software engineering and embedded systems.- It encourages us to further discover and contribute to this growing community.","","978-1-4673-1852-5","","10.1109/SEES.2012.6225483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225483","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20120628","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A method to handle the complexity of automotive software is Model Based Design (MBD). As MBD offers great advantages in early simulation and testing, it has become today's mainstream method for automotive software engineering. However, some aspects can be initially tested after the integration of software on real hardware components (usually by the supplier) and when all parts of a system (e.g. bus systems, sensors, actuators) are present. The consequence is that the requirement specification of the according system possibly contains gaps that can lead to software defects. New technologies like the AUTOSAR standard enable additional potentials for the validation of model based developed software. Due to the AUTOSAR software architecture it is possible for an OEM to realize an early ??virtual?? software integration with an acceptable effort and perform at next step a front loading of system tests. In this paper we present an approach that improves the quality of the requirement specification artifacts by using test front loading. In detail, we analyze the requirement engineering part of the software development process to identify aspects that can not be tested without having all system components. Afterwards, we classify these aspects and define an abstract test pattern that can be globally used for testing.

Topographic and thematic maps in 2D can be produced using photogrammetric technique. In photogrammetry, the three dimensional (3D) stereomodel can be used to generate 3D model. Today, 3D model can be generated using various techniques and there exists an increasing need to use 3D model in various fields such as civil engineering, architecture, archaeology, town planning, automotive industry and others especially for visualization applications. 3D model also can be generated using aerial photogrammetry and close range photogrammetry methods to generate 3D model of the earth surface and objects located on it. Several photogrammetric softwares provide different accuracy of 3D model which can be used to generate 3D model such as Erdas Imagine, Topcon PI 3000 Image Master, Leica Photogrammetric Suite, VirtuoZo and others. This paper presents the use of photogrammetric technique to effectively generate three dimensional (3D) model of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia campus. The software used are Erdas IMAGINE, SpacEyes3D Builder, Google SketchUp as well as AutoCAD Map. The processing procedure of the system is described briefly in this paper. Sets of measurements (length, width, and height) of selected buildings were obtained. The results obtained from these software were compared with ground survey measurement. The results showed that an accuracy of sub-meter of ±0.491m could be obtained from the Erdas Imagine software and it is superior compared with the other two software.

RTAS '07. 13th IEEE","3-6 April 2007","2007","","","3","11","This paper proposes a new development method for highly reliable real-time embedded control systems using a CPU model-based hardware/software co-simulation. We take an approach that allows the full simulation of the virtual mechanical control system including the mechatronics plant, microcontroller hardware and object code level software. This full virtual system simulation reveals the control system behavior, especially in microcontroller hardware and software. It enables microarchitecture design space exploration, control design validation, robustness evaluation of the system, software optimization before components design, and prevents potential problems. A novel aspect of this work is that the proposed virtual control system comprises all the components in a typical control system, therefore it enables the analysis of the effects from the different domains, for example the mechanical analysis of behavior due to a control software bug. To help the design, evaluation and analysis, we developed an integrated behavior analyzer into the development environment. This can display the processor behavior graphically during the simulation without affecting the simulation results, such as task level CPU load, interrupt statistics and software variable transition chart. This analyzer provides useful information on the behavior. No software modification is necessary for this virtual system analysis, and this analysis does not change the control timing and does not require any processing power on the target microcontroller. Therefore this method is suitable for real-time embedded control system design, in particular automotive control system design which requires high level reliability, robustness, quality and safety. In this paper, a Renesas SH-2A microcontroller model was developed on a CoMETtrade platform from VaST Systems Technology. An ETC (electronic throttle control) system is chosen as the plant to prove this concept. The ETB (electronic throttle body) model on Saberr- eg simulator from Synopsysreg was co-simulated with the SH-2A model. The SH-2A chip was under development during this project, nevertheless we could complete the OSEK OS development, control software design and verification using the virtual system. We confirmed that such software could run on an actual ETC hardware system without modification after a working sample chip was released at a later stage in the course of this work.

"Taming complexity while gaining efficiency: Requirements for the next generation of test automation tools","Bansal, A.; Muli, M.; Patil, K.","dSPACE Inc., Wixom, MI, USA","AUTOTESTCON, 2013 IEEE","16-19 Sept. 2013","2013","","","1","6","The current product development environment for mechatronic systems is characterized by tight budgets, reduced development times and immense complexity across the industries - aerospace, automotive, commercial vehicles, etc. A huge emphasis is being given to increase the efficiency in product testing and to make the process more productive in increasing quality, while being cost effective. Companies are seeking software testing tools that offer a comprehensive solution that helps in achieving this goal. Automated software testing for both hardware and the software components is one of the ways the industries are trying to gain efficiency in testing. Given the fact that current mechatronic systems are quite complex, have large numbers and types of IO channels, and are implementing distributed real-time control with multiple communication protocols, a test automation tool that incorporates and tests all of the system functionality is highly desirable. In particular, due to the focus on software quality, as more and more functions are added to the network of Electronic Control Units (ECU), a greater emphasis is laid on the requirements for a comprehensive automated testing tool. The efficiency in development and planned increase in reuse of test assets is an important consideration for efficiency gain. Bringing clarity to the test description would improve readability and maintainability of these test assets. This paper shows the lessons learned from a similar evolution in Model-Based Design, moving from handwritten code to model-based graphical executable representation, can be applied to the testing arena to develop better and more efficient tests. To make the testing process efficient, the test tool should be able to not just execute tests, but organize the test results and present them in a manner easily understood by the end user. The user should be easily able to select tests to be executed and visualize execution results of those tests without need of external - ata analysis and reporting tools. A user should also be able to gather data related to test execution for reporting on overall software quality metrics. In the case of real-time embedded systems, the traditional approach for software testing of test execution, data capture, analysis and reporting creates a lot of inefficiency and repeated testing. A new approach to run test evaluation in parallel to test execution, using the so-called real-time testing solution, eliminates these inefficiencies and results in significant gains in testing time and improving utilization of the test infrastructure. Globalized, distributed development environments may lead to organizations adopting a variety of tool chains and test platforms. Therefore, to gain efficiency, it is desired that the test automation solution should offer easy integration with other third-party test platforms and be independent of the hardware to protect the investment in the long run. Basing such integration interface on established standards gives the user freedom to make choices. Some standards, such as HIL API from ASAM, are being proposed for test systems in the automotive industry. The paper reviews applicability and benefits of such standards. Various industry standards, such as automotive functional safety standard ISO 26262, IEC 61508, IEC 62304 and DO-178C, have addressed requirements for software testing and test tools. It is therefore critical that the selected test automation tool provide support for the prescribed methods and support the standard compliant development process. Tool qualification is a critical topic addressed by these standards and is discussed in this paper. Further, increasingly important requirements such as integration with the overall software development process, management of tests and test data, test reusability, hardware platform independence, test development and execution efficiency, etc. are discussed.","1088-7725","978-1-4673-5681-7","","10.1109/AUTEST.2013.6645055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645055","Automated Testing;HIL;Real-time systems","Automation;Complexity theory;Industries;Real-time systems;Software;Standards;Testing","automatic testing;mechatronics;standards","automated software testing;comprehensive automated testing tool;electronic control units;hardware platform;mechatronic systems;model based design;model based graphical execution;product development environment;real time testing solution;real-time embedded syste;software testing tools;test asset reuse;test automation tools;test reusability;test standard;testing complexity;testing efficiency","","","","0","","","","","20131024","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effects of this change on development processes, methods, and tools as well as on required engineering skills were very significant and are still ongoing today. At present there is a new trend in the automotive industry towards model-based development. Software components are no longer handwritten in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulinktrade, Statemate, or similar tools. However, quality assurance of model-based developments, especially testing, is still poorly supported. Many development projects require creation of expensive proprietary testing solutions. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of automotive model-based development processes, the consequences for test development and the need to reconsider testing procedures in practice. Furthermore, we introduce the test tool ""TPT"" which masters the complexity of model-based testing in the automotive domain. To illustrate this statement we present a small automotive case study. TPT is based on graphical test models that are not only easy to understand but also powerful enough to express very complex, fully automated closed loop tests in real-time.

CBSD together with software product line (SPL) practice has improved software reuse, productivity, quality and complexity management, by raising the level of abstraction for software constructions and by sharing services. Although CBSD has contributed to the aforementioned improvement in the software development practice, the existing Bosch component model often requires software developers to take a close look at the implementation including models (e.g., ASCET-MD ) and even complex source code to understand software behavior and dependencies when reusing and adapting software components. This hinders the realization of the full benefits of CBSD, as the available information on the component level does not sufficiently describe important aspects of software behavior.

For electric vehicles, software functions play an essential role, replacing hydraulic and mechanic control systems. While model-based software development and verification are already used extensively in the automotive domain, their importance significantly increases in electric vehicles as safety-critical functions might no longer rely on mechanical (fall-back) solutions. The need for reducing costs, size, and weight in electric vehicles has also resulted in a considerable interest in topics such as the consolidation of ECUs as well as efficient implementation of control software. In this paper we discuss two broad issues related to model-based software development and verification in electric vehicles. The first is concerned with how to ensure that model-level semantics are preserved in an implementation, which has important implications on the verification and certification of control software.

The amount of software has increased over the last years and, therefore, the verification of embedded software has got a fundamental importance. One of the main problems in embedded software verification is to stress and cover variables and functions in the embedded software that is already running on microprocessor models, during the design phase. In this paper we present a novel approach to verify embedded software running on a microprocessor model, based on a coverage driven verification technique.

Safety and reliability are important requirements for automotive software and software testing is still the main source of ensuring dependability of the software artifacts. Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) have been long used to assess the reliability of software systems; they are also used for predicting the defect inflow in order to allocate maintenance resources. Although a number of models have been proposed and evaluated, much of the assessment of their predictive ability is studied for short term (e.g. last 10% of data). But in practice (in industry) the usefulness of SRGMs with respect to optimal resource allocation depends heavily on the long term predictive power of SRGMs i.e. much before the project is close to completion. The ability to reasonably predict the expected defect inflow provides important insight that can help project and quality managers to take necessary actions related to testing resource allocation on time to ensure high quality software at the release. In this paper we evaluate the long-term predictive power of commonly used SRGMs on four software projects from the automotive sector. The results indicate that Gompertz and Logistic model performs best among the tested models on all fit criterias as well as on predictive power, although these models are not reliable for long-term prediction with partial data.","","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698922","","Automotive engineering;Data models;Predictive models;Software;Software reliability;Testing","software quality;software reliability","Gompertz model;SRGM;automotive industry;automotive software;automotive systems;high quality software;logistic model;long-term predictive power;optimal resource allocation;software testing;standard reliability growth models","","","","0","","","","","20140102","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, the scenario is rapidly evolving while adding further complexity, with the integration of the upcoming AUTOSAR standard for the definition of application-level components and automotive software/hardware architectures. This talk will outline some of the challenges and possible solutions for the development of modern automotive systems in a model-based flow.

For these reasons, embedded systems have became more complicated and require a lot of time for designing. Model-based programming has came into the spotlight in the embedded system industry that demands short time-to-market, especially in the automotive industry. Model-based programming allows the developer to design and implement the system easily by using blocks that provide automatic code-generation function. In addition, blocks provide the simulation function at the design and implementation step. Among the model-based programming's features, simulation is of greatest importance because accurate simulation can reduce cost, time and effort. Most simulators just estimate that the model works correctly without consideration of hardware characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes the new hybrid-block that can simulate not only functions of the model, but also features of hardware. We develop the 16-bit embedded system for the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in the automotive system and implement the hybrid-blocks that have two modes of automatic code-generation and simulation. The application model can be constructed by using the hybrid-block. In automatic code-generation mode, models can generate complete C program code for a specific platform without any modification. In simulation mode, the model can be simulated by considering the hardware and software characteristics of the model. In this paper, consequence of simulation with real-value in the 16-bit embedded system is compared.","","978-89-950038-6-2","978-89-950038-6-2","10.1109/ICCAS.2007.4406575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406575","Automatic code-generation;ECU;Embedded system;Model-based programming;Simulation","Application software;Automatic control;Automatic programming;Automotive engineering;Costs;Embedded system;Functional programming;Hardware;Mathematical model;Time to market","automatic programming;automobile industry;automotive electronics;digital simulation;embedded systems;program compilers","Matlab;Simulink;automatic code generation function;automotive industry;automotive system;complete C program code;electronic control unit;embedded systems;hardware characteristics;model-based programming","","","","0","","11","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the increasing degree of distribution and interaction of ECUs, many approaches are adopted to design the in-vehicle networks to ensure the stability and reliability of the holistic network, but none of them support the synchronous development of in-vehicle networks and software in ECUs. This paper put forward a model-based approach to design the in-vehicle networks and the software in ECUs with presenting a dependable platform compliant with OSEK/VDX specifications. The paper presents a tool-chain that covers the entire system development life-cycle including system modeling, model transformation, model analysis, network simulation, code generation, document generation and runtime instrumentation. In addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the approach. The contribution of the approach is threefold.

Although the standard mainly focuses on software architecture, it also provides a development methodology. Unfortunately, the methodology in its current form is insufficient for industrial exploitation because it describes only an incomplete set of activities, work products and their dependencies. Specifically, (1) the activities to support COTS-based development are missing even though AUTOSAR encourages the use of COTS components; (2) it does not describe the roles and their responsibilities; and (3) it does not specify the mapping of activities onto a complete process model. In this paper, we propose a new software development process for AUTOSAR by extending the existing methodology. In doing so, we add activities to allow COTS component selection, evaluation and integration. Then, we define specific roles and assign responsibilities to those roles. Finally, we describe the overall timeline of various activities in detail by mapping the activities to the V-model. In order to present the process, we have used SPEM 2.0 notation, which is backward compatible with the AUTOSAR methodology and has improved expressiveness. We have composed the proposed process model using Eclipse Process Framework Composer which not only performs a sanity check of the model but also provides a way to publish it.","","978-1-4244-4109-9","978-1-4244-4110-5","10.1109/SIES.2009.5196192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196192","AUTOSAR;COTS;Process Modeling;SPEM;component","Automotive engineering;Collaboration;Computer industry;Computer science;Electrical products industry;Programming;Software architecture;Software standards;Standards development;Unified modeling language","automobile industry;object-oriented programming;production engineering computing;software architecture","AUTOSAR methodology;COTS components;COTS-based development process;Eclipse Process Framework Composer;SPEM 2.0 notation;V-Model;automotive industry;automotive software;industrial exploitation;open standard;software architecture;software development process","","","","5","","6","","","20090807","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Drawing from recent advancements in the mobile phone operating systems, we propose an Android-based software architecture which supports the play-and-play in automotive systems. In our architecture, an application can be downloaded from cloud services and executed on ECUs in a distributed fashion.

The usability of their HMIs (human-machine interfaces) has been improved considerably. However the complexity of the HMI software is growing. Testing the HMI became very demanding and time consuming. Because of multiplicity of HMI variants, a better code coverage is a goal for the development process of most manufacturers. Model-based testing is one way to achieve a better code coverage and keep the costs and complexity acceptable. However, the existing research approaches in the area of model-based HMI testing can not satisfy the needs for our testing purposes. In the work a model-based testing approach will be proposed for testing both the logical behavior and the graphical interface of the automotive infotainment HMI. As an important part of the testing approach a test-oriented HMI specification model will be designed. It is a model, which describes the required behavior of the HMI and contains the necessary information for the testing process. Test generation methods and the design of tests will also be proposed. These results can be generally used for testing advanced GUI-driven applications. Specific coverage criteria for infotainment HMIs, methods for automatic test generation and verification of the system behavior are also focuses of the work.

Recently, more and more vehicles, such as BMW X5, are connected from outside via smart phone[3]. From smart phone, users can use the internet resources in automotive. Also, from smart phone users can monitor the automotives. When the automotive is moving or stolen by robber, an alert information will be reported to users and users can even brake their automotive via smart phone in emergency status by sending control command to the vehicle information gateway. So a client software in smart phone is required to monitor the sensor network in automotives. And to prevent the client software is maliciously used by robbers, a security mechanism should be given for this client on the constraints of computation power, security level and power consumption. We proposed to encrypt all the messages in IDEA, which is with high security level and prone to implement in software and less demands on computation power. The critical data is suggested being stored in record management set, a mechanism based on Java MIDlet. And a communication transaction management is also proposed for SMS/MMS communication between the client software and its gateway.

For such applications, typically there is strong cooperation between dedicated hardware modules and software systems. An important issue toward a fully automated system-level implementation is represented by the software development process. The basic requirements are: accurate timing characterization to be used during the early stages of the design to compare alternative architectures and reliable synthesis techniques to ensure the respect of the correct functionality by avoiding, as much as possible, the direct designer's intervention during the development process. This paper describes a novel methodology to address the needs of concurrently synthesizing the software component of a control-dominated hardware-software system, possibly under real-time constraints. An intermediate model (Virtual Instruction Set) for the software is presented, suitable for both for synthesis and analysis purposes.

These approaches have been implemented by several tools and successfully applied to various development projects. However, the everyday use of model-based approaches in the automotive and avionic industries is still limited. Most of the time, the engineers work with a predefined set of isolated tools, and therefore adapt their engineering methods and process to the available tools. Today, the industry achieves tool integration by demand-driven, pragmatic, and ad-hoc composed chains of a priori existent commercial tools. Nevertheless, these tool chains are not (and cannot be) seamless, since the integration that can be achieved is not deep enough. This hampers the reuse and refinement of models, which subsequently leads to problems like redundancy, inconsistency, and lack of automation. In the end, these deficiencies decrease both the productivity and quality that could be provided by model-based approaches. To overcome these problems, a deep, coherent, and comprehensive integration of models and tools is required. Such an integration can be achieved by the following three ingredients: 1) a comprehensive modeling theory that serves as a semantic domain for the models, 2) an integrated architectural model that holistically describes the product and process, and 3) a manner to build tools that conform to the modeling theory and allow the authoring of the product model. We show that from a scientific point of view, all ingredients are at our hands to do a substantial step into an integrated process and tool world. Further, we illustrate why such a solution has not been achieved so far, and discuss what is to be done to get a step closer to seamless model-based engineering.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2037771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420030","Common model repository;comprehensive modeling theory;generic tooling platform;integrated engineering environments;iterative language engineering;seamless model-based development;workflow support","","automobile industry;avionics;embedded systems;production engineering computing;software engineering","ad-hoc composed tool chains;automotive industry;avionic industry;commercial tools;comprehensive modeling theory;embedded software-intensive systems;integrated architectural model;integrated model engineering environments;isolated tools;model-based development;tool building manner","","","","5","","60","","2010-02-25","20100329","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Classical CBSD approaches enable effective software reuse mainly in functional aspects by managing complexity with abstraction and encapsulation. However, to fully exploit the advantages of CBSD for real-time embedded systems, non-functional system properties such as timing and memory usage need to be addressed by the underlying component model. It is important that non-functional properties have a certain degree of precision to ensure hardware dimensioning and cost optimization for such systems. Static analysis methods used to extract or analyze nonfunctional properties (e.g., worst case execution time) in most cases introduce overestimation which is a hindrance for accurate prediction of non-functional properties. Therefore, accurate prediction of system properties requires specifying semantic context information such as modes in the component model to reduce overestimation. This paper describes how we extend the Bosch software component model to specify non-functional component properties with modes information. We demonstrate how mode dependent timing behavior is automatically extracted from the software, specified in the component specification and used for analysis and prediction in real-time embedded systems. This paper shows that semantic context information such as modes enhances performance analysis and prediction by ruling out infeasible worst-case situations that lead to overly conservative performance predictions.","","978-1-4244-3495-4","","10.1109/ICSE-COMPANION.2009.5070961","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070961","","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Data mining;Embedded software;Embedded system;Engines;Programming;Real time systems;Software systems;Timing","automotive engineering;control engineering computing;embedded systems;internal combustion engines;object-oriented programming;program diagnostics;software reusability","Bosch;automotive systems;component based real-time embedded software development;cost optimization;engine control systems;hardware dimensioning;resource constrained real-time embedded systems;software reuse;software system properties;static analysis methods","","","","2","","19","","","20090612","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particular strengths of Simulink are rapid design and algorithm exploration. Moreover, commercial tools are available to generate embedded C or HDL code directly from a Simulink model. On the other hand, Simulink models are purely functional models and, hence, designers cannot seamlessly consider the architecture that a Simulink model is later implemented on. In particular, it is not possible to explore the different architectural alternatives and investigate the arising interactions and side-effects directly within Simulink. To benefit from Matlab/Simulink's algorithm exploration capabilities and overcome the outlined drawbacks, this work introduces a model transformation framework that converts a Simulink model to an executable specification, written in an actor-oriented modeling language. This specification then serves as the input of well-established Electronic System Level (ESL) design flows that, e. g., enables Design Space Exploration (DSE) and automatic code generation for both hardware and software. We also present a validation technique that considers the functional correctness by comparing the original Simulink model with the generated specification in a co-simulation environment. The co-simulation can also be used to evaluate the performance of implementation candidates during DSE.

AutoPlug consists of multiple ECUs interconnected by a CAN bus, a race car driving simulator which behaves as the plant model and a vehicle safety and performance monitor in Matlab. As the ECUs drive the simulated vehicle, the physics-based simulation provides feedback to the controllers in terms of acceleration, yaw, friction and vehicle stability. This closed-loop platform is then used to evaluate multiple vehicle control software modules such as traction, stability and cruise control. With this test-bed we are aim to develop ECU software diagnosis and testing to evaluate the effect on the stability and performance of the vehicle.

However the efficient development of reliable control software is difficult. We have proposed to introduce a “model-based design” process using MATLAB/Simulink, established in the automotive and aerospace fields, to the development of power electronics systems. However, it was difficult in the past because calculating switching circuit as the plant model is difficult in MATLAB/Simulink due to the socalled stiff equation problem. Thus, in this study, we have developed a simulation environment in which the standard model-based design tool, MATLAB/Simulink, and the simulation engine for power switching circuits, SCALE, work cooperatively. SCALE was originally developed to solve stiff equation and efficiently simulate power switching circuits. This software environment enables us to design control algorithms with intuitive block diagram expression and test them in actual hardware, without writing a C program. Furthermore to improve this environment, a mechanism that handles the multiple sample rates was introduced. Smart energy systems that use several controllers with different sampling rates can be simulated in the proposed environment. Thus, we can develop control software for smart energy systems in a timely and cost effective manner.","","978-1-4673-2328-4","978-1-4673-2329-1","10.1109/ICRERA.2012.6477477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477477","control;model-based design;simulation;software","Batteries;Computational modeling;Control systems;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Software packages","C language;control engineering computing;power electronics;power engineering computing;smart power grids;switching circuits;switching convertors","C program;Matlab-Simulink;SCALE;aerospace fields;automotive fields;block diagram expression;complex control software;control algorithms design;multisample-rate controllers;power converters;power electronics systems;power switching circuits;reliable control software;sampling rates;simulation environment;smart energy applications;standard model-based design tool;stiff equation problem","","","","0","","7","","","20130314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This revolutionizes the optoelectronics market, enabling engineers to use LEDs for general lighting applications as well as medical, indoor lighting and automotive solutions. So variable LED array modules were developed, they are making great strides in terms of lumen performance and reliability, however the barrier to widespread use in general illumination still remains the cost or luminous efficiency, special requirements concerning optical properties and optomechanical layout have to be met. In order to meet the requirements of indoor illumination, a LED daylight lamp model was designed, it can replace traditional fluorescent lamp without insteading additional power supply establishment. The optical properties of the model were simulated using optical analysis software, its luminous efficiency is about 41 lm/W, the illuminance is about 50 lux when the distance is 1.5 m between the center of the model and measured spot, With the theoretically-optimized design of the LED model, experiments based on the results of the optimal simulation in the laboratory were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed LED model, it reaches a power factor of about 0.8 at 11 W. Results of the simulation are very similar with the measured values, it was testified that simulative method is one of the effective tools for LED lighting optical design.","","978-1-4244-2739-0","978-1-4244-2740-6","10.1109/ICEPT.2008.4606997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606997","","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Biomedical optical imaging;Fluorescent lamps;LED lamps;Light emitting diodes;Lighting;Optical arrays;Power measurement;Software measurement","LED lamps;integrated optoelectronics;lighting;modules;optical design techniques;reliability","LED array modules;LED daylight lamp lighting system;LED lighting optical design;distance 1.5 m;high brightness LED;lighting applications;lumen performance;luminous efficiency;optical analysis software;optical properties;optoelectronics market;optomechanical layout;power 11 W;reliability","","","","8","","4","","","20080822","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional designs are based on the concept of a <i>Federated Architecture</i> in which integrated hardware/software components [Electronic Control Units (ECUs)] realize mostly independent or loosely interconnected functions. These components are connected by bus and cooperate by exchanging messages. This paradigm is now being replaced by the <i>Integrated Architecture</i>, - the concept comes from Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) introduced by the avionics community (see C. B. Watkins and R. Walter, ?Transitioning from federated avionics architectures to integrated modular avionics?, in Proc. 26th Digital Avionics Syst. Conf., Oct. 2007) but it is certainly general and applicable to other fields and in particular, automotive - in which software components can be supplied from multiple sources, integrated on the same hardware platform or physically distributed and possibly moved from one CPU to another without loss of functional and time correctness and providing a guaranteed level of reliability. This shift will decouple software design from the hardware platform design and provide opportunities for the optimization of the architecture configuration, increased extensibility, flexibility and modularity. However, the integration of software components in a distributed system realizing a complex functional behavior and characterized by safety, time and reliability constraints requires a much tighter control on the component model and its semantics, new methods and tools for analyzing the results of the composition, whether by simulation or formal methods, and methods for exploring the architecture solution space and optimizing the configuration. We provide a general overview of existing challenges and possible solutions to the design and analysis problem, <i>with - - special focus on the automotive domain</i>. The development of such methods and tools must necessarily consider compatibility with existing modeling languages and standards, including UML, AUTOSAR and synchronous reactive models, on which the widely used commercial products Simulink and SCADE are based.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2039550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440059","Architecture;automotive electronic system;automotive software;design methodology;design space exploration;system design","","automotive electronics;computational complexity;electronic engineering computing;reliability;software engineering","ECU;IMA;aeronautics architectures;architecture configuration;automotive architectures;cost pressure;distributed system;electronic control units;exchanging messages;extensibility;federated architectures;flexibility;functional complexity;functional correctness;fundamental paradigms;hardware components;hardware platform design;integrated architectures;integrated modular avionics;optimization;software components;synchronous reactive models;time correctness","","","","14","","70","","","20100329","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Optimal state and control trajectories are calculated using BockÂ¿s direct multiple shooting method implemented in the software MUSCOD-II. The developed approach is illustrated both in simulation and experimentally for a test case where a vehicle accelerates from 1100 rpm to 3700 rpm in 30 s. The optimized trajectories yield minimal fuel consumption. The experiments show that the optimal engine speed trajectory yields a reduction of the fuel consumption of 12% when compared to a linear trajectory.

Not all possibly interesting data can be stored because of the limited memory available in a tested vehicle. On-board preprocessing of data and decisions about which information has to be kept or omitted is thus vital for vehicle testing routines. This paper introduces a method for flexible on-board processing of sensor data of a vehicle. The approach is motivated by sensor network ideas and makes use of stream processing techniques. A processing graph model for automotive applications is proposed, which consists of operator nodes and connecting data streams. This model supplies both recording and processing functionality together. To account for dynamic changes of conditions within a vehicle-most of the time only a small portion of the vehicle states are interesting for diagnosis-both the model and actual software are built in such a way that the whole system can automatically be adapted at runtime whenever certain conditions are detected. The proposed stream processing model has been implemented in a proof-of-concept industrial application, that was deployed to an automotive on-board unit. Results show that this approach effectively trades a little more on-board processing power for a large data volume, that does not need to be saved and transmitted for off-board usage anymore.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2009.2037145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353626","Data aggregation;embedded systems;on-board diagnosis;stream processing;vehicle sensor data","","automobile industry;controller area networks;data recording;embedded systems;vehicles","automotive;automotive sensor data;data streams;flexible on-board stream processing;operator nodes;processing graph model;sensor network;vehicle diagnosis","","","","7","","27","","2009-12-15","20100205","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Industrial Applications Society;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society;IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The geometric complexity of automotive surfaces and the complexity of the spray patterns produced by modern paint atomizers combine to make this a challenging and interesting problem. This paper documents our efforts to develop computationally tractable analytic deposition models for electrostatic rotating bell (ESRB) atomizers, which have recently become widely used in the automotive painting industry. The models presented in this paper account for both the effects of surface curvature as well as the deposition pattern of ESRB atomizers in a computationally tractable form, enabling the development of automated trajectory generation tools. We present experimental results used to develop and validate the models, and verify the interaction between the deposition pattern, the atomizer trajectory, and the surface curvature. Limitations of the deposition model with respect to predictions of paint deposition on highly curved surfaces are discussed. Note to Practitioners-The empirical paint deposition models developed herein, which are fit to experimental data, offer a significant improvement over models that are typically used in industrial robot simulations. The improved simulation results come without the computational cost and complexity of finite element methods. The models could be incorporated, as is, into existing industrial simulation tools, provided the users are cognizant of the model limitations with respect to highly curved surfaces. Although the models are based on readily available information, incorporating the models into existing robot simulation software would likely require support from the software vendor.","1545-5955","","","10.1109/TASE.2005.851631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514457","Automotive painting;coverage;trajectory planning","Atomic layer deposition;Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Electrostatic analysis;Painting;Paints;Service robots;Spraying;Surface fitting;Trajectory","automobile industry;industrial manipulators;painting;path planning;position control;spray coating techniques;spray coatings","analytic deposition models;atomizer trajectory;automated trajectory generation tools;automotive painting industry;automotive surfaces;deposition pattern;electrostatic rotating bell atomizers;geometric complexity;paint atomizers;paint deposition modeling;spray pattern complexity;surface curvature;trajectory planning tools","","","","13","1","20","","","20051003","","IEEE","IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings","9-12 March 1999","1999","","","4","","Abstract only given, as follows. The increasing demand for dynamically controlled safety features, driving comfort and operational convenience in upper class cars require an intensive use of ECUs (electronic control units) including software. A network of up to 70 ECUs which are communicating via buses is mandatory for the required functionality. On the one hand, complexity of ECUs is rapidly increasing and time to market is decreasing. On the other hand, automotive electronics is developed together with many suppliers under control of the OEMs. Furthermore, 30% of the value added in automotives is up to electronics. Thus, from a technical, an administrative and from a business point of view the car manufacturers have a vital interest to improve and shorten the software development process for ECUs together with all partners involved. As a consequence, a general objective is to improve the ECU development process based on standards. Besides OSEK as an already accepted standard for ECU software operating systems in Germany, the OEMs are also interested in standards for bus systems or for model exchange formats, to mention just a few.

The basic way to test and optimize is by measuring and calibrating the process. One of the common methods to solve this problem is dasiaHardware-in-the-Looppsila(HIL). With this method, the real ECU is place in a simulative environment for the software under test. The software runs on the real target hardware. The basic idea with dasiaSoftware-in-the-Looppsila(SIL) is the same, except that all runs on standard PC hardware. [1] Both for HIL and SIL many simulated models for automotive industry are made in MATLAB/Simulink. A way how to put ECU's software into MATLAB/Simulink in order to have a complete testing environment will reduce considerably the testing costs and time to market. To have a unitary view both for HIL and SIL we must use the same approach. To keep the consistency we should use the same measurement and application tool, in our case CANApe. This will be done using XCP protocol based on Ethernet TCP/IP transport layer. [2] The entire ECU's software will be wrapped into a MATLAB/Simulink S-Function.

The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a “Cold Start Emission” control problem in passenger cars. A non-linear model-based controller is designed to reduce cold start hydrocarbon emissions from a mid-size modern passenger car. The controller robustness is analyzed by testing the controller against the major steps occurring during the software implementation process of a controller.

The uptake of AUTOSAR for the integration of application software, with common embedded device driver components, offers the opportunity for the partitioning and business model of automotive electrical architecture design to change. Currently control of a system is centralised into a single function specific ECU requiring hard wiring to all sensors and actuators. Situations such as this lead to an over complication in system partitioning, unnecessary wiring and connectors, and often a large number of medium performance ECUs integrated by a number of CAN buses. A neater, simpler and more cost effective solution to the design and system partitioning problem may be to reduce the number of specialist ECUs integrated by CAN and replace with generic ECUs integrated with a faster network such as FlexRay. The problem then becomes how to determine the trade off between all of the possible design parameters which may include cost, electronic control system functionality, sensor/actuator placement. This paper describes an investigation into cost modelling of a vehicle electrical architecture to support decisions on system partitioning and in-vehicle control network choice. A LIN bus cost model is developed and it is shown how this can in turn be developed into a cost model for the entire vehicle electrical architecture based on hardware and software costs.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-815-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383632","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20071119","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

In order to verify temporal properties, formal approaches are efficient, but only applicable for small or medium sized software modules, where they have less state space to explore. Conventional simulation-based methods are still dependent on the systems to be applied and they have additionally the coverage problem, i.e., only the paths executed during the simulation can be monitored. This work presents a semiformal verification approach called SofTPaDS, which is based on the combination of both assertion-based and symbolic simulation approaches for the verification of embedded software with hardware dependencies. This combination shows to be more efficient than the state-of-the-art software model checkers in order to trace deep spaces, and presents improvements of the state coverage relative to a simulation-based verification tool.

One major challenge is the current existence of two different emerging standards for this domain, AUTOSAR and EAST-ADL2. These potential standards should be borne in mind during the software product line introduction because they may someday become mandatory. In addition, the existing development process should be changed as little as possible, and one final important requirement for the software product line is the implementation of a single point of control to ensure consistency between various development artifacts. To this end, we propose a lightweight introduction of EAST-ADL2 as a documentation tool only as an initial step. This is achieved by extracting structural information from AUTOSAR models and automatically generating the corresponding EAST-ADL2 representation. The automatic generation ensures consistency between AUTOSAR and EAST-ADL2 models. As an important side effect, variability information can be extracted in this transformation step and used to build an EAST-ADL2 compositional variability model. This model can then be mapped to the central domain model and used to configure the EAST-ADL2 documentation to the other development artifacts consistently. In this way, we can accomplish the lightweight introduction of EAST-ADL2 in the development process through the automatic generation and use the generated variability information for configuration from a single control point.","1530-1605","978-1-4577-1925-7","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6149565","","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Data mining;Hardware;Sensors;Software;Unified modeling language","automotive engineering;information retrieval;product development;production engineering computing;software engineering","AUTOSAR model;EAST-ADL2 compositional variability model;EAST-ADL2 documentation tool;EAST-ADL2 representation;automatic generation;automotive software product line;structural information extraction;transformation step;variability information extraction","","","","0","","25","","","20120209","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

How well these tasks are performed significantly impacts the quality of the developed software system. The difficulty of these tasks is greatly exacerbated for the software of embedded systems as these systems are commonly used for critical applications, have to operate reliably for long periods of time, and usually have a high degree of complexity. Current embedded systems software development practice, however, often deals with the (requirements) analysis phase in a superficial manner, instead emphasizing design and implementation. This research investigates how an approach similar to the well-known design patterns, termed object analysis patterns, can be applied in the analysis phase of embedded systems development, prior to design and coding. Specifically, our research explores how object-oriented modeling notations, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), can be used to represent structural and behavioral information as part of commonly occurring object analysis patterns. This work also investigates how UML-based conceptual models of embedded systems, based on the diagram templates in the object analysis patterns, can be automatically analyzed using the Spin model checker for adherence to properties specified in linear-time temporal logic (LTL) using a previously developed UML formalization framework. We have applied these patterns to several embedded systems applications obtained from the automotive industry. This paper describes one of our case studies and illustrates how our approach facilitates the construction of UML-based conceptual models of embedded systems and the analysis of these models for adherence to functional requirements.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2004.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377192","","Application software;Automatic logic units;Embedded software;Embedded system;Information analysis;Object oriented modeling;Pattern analysis;Programming;Software systems;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;embedded systems;formal specification;formal verification;object-oriented methods;object-oriented programming;software quality;temporal logic","Spin model checker;Unified Modeling Language;automotive industry;behavioral information;design pattern;embedded system;linear-time temporal logic;object analysis pattern;object-oriented modeling;software development;software system;structural information","","","","13","","53","","","20050110","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since the application area for the development of such systems is very broad, e.g. including automotive, aeronautics, robotics or consumer products and much more, on top the need for flexible and adaptable methods for the development of such systems arises as well. Such complex, interdisciplinary systems are also called mechatronic systems, referring to the synergistic integration of software, electronics and mechanics. To approach the complexity inherent in the discipline-spanning aspect, different development and integrations methods and techniques coming from the involved disciplines are applied. Especially the interdisciplinary aspect of mechatronics, makes it difficult to handle such development and still there is no such thing as a promoted unified mechatronic modeling and design language, which is capable of describing a joint model with sufficient details to manage the large number of involved system-aspects included in each of the representative domains-specific disciplines. In order to obtain a coherent model from the entire mechatronic system, an integrated model framework capable to manage various requirements and modeling specifications present in each discipline is needed. This paper will provide a comprehensive review regarding the evolution of design methodologies for mechatronic systems, investigate recent research approaches in the realm of model-based design, and also point out the problems and limitations inherent in the different concepts and finally summarize the most promising research directions.","","978-1-4673-2347-5","","10.1109/MESA.2012.6275567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275567","Mechatronic Component;Model Integrated Mechatronics;SysML;System Modeling;Systems Engineering;UML;modeling techniques","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Mechatronics;Object oriented modeling;Solid modeling;Unified modeling language","mechatronics;product design","aeronautics product;automotive product;consumer product;design methodology;electronics;engineering approach;mechanics;mechatronic design concept;model-based design;robotics product;software;system development","","","","0","","31","","","20120823","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The high reliability requirements of safety critical software systems make this task imperative as well. Due to the specifics of software systems and the lack of any universally accepted models it is very difficult to predict the true reliability value of the system. Unfortunately none of the existing software reliability models neither acknowledge nor address this fact. There exist multiple uncertainty factors that influence reliability estimation of safety critical software systems. In this paper, we first define the scope of the important factors in the reliability models and describe a new approach to obtain a realistic estimate for system reliability. For this purpose, we consider different kinds of reliability models also taking into account the system architecture. The influence of uncertainty factors in the models is analyzed to obtain uncertainty bounds. They show an interval, where the true reliability should lie within it. This way system architects may use a so-called worst-case reliability estimation, given by the lower interval bound, for system analysis. We also demonstrate our proposed approach with real data taken from safety-critical applications.","","978-1-4244-7435-6","","10.1109/SSIRI.2010.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502837","Safety-Critical Systems;Software Reliability;Software Reliability Models;Uncertainty","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Embedded software;Hardware;Software reliability;Software safety;Software systems;Space technology;Uncertainty","software reliability","automotive systems;computer based systems;modeling uncertainties;pragmatic approach;safety critical operations;safety-critical applications;software reliability estimation;system architecture;uncertainty bounds;uncertainty factors","","","","3","","37","","","20100708","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network/platform model consists of processing elements abstracted by real-time operating systems, communication systems, sensors, and actuators.

However, current methods for fulfilling non-functional requirements lack of support for commercial-off-the-shelf software modules, which are very common in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a concept, mapping nonfunctional aspects to given commercial-off-the-shelf modules with means of configuration models. The non-functional aspects are described in feature models; the given implementation is described in configuration models. The mapping between these models describes the impact of the selection of non-functional features to the configuration model. With our concept, the implementation of non-functional requirements is transferred into a transformation between feature models and configuration models. Therefore, the integration of commercial software modules into product families considering non-functional requirements becomes possible.","","978-3-8007-2956-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5755443","","Atmospheric modeling;Hardware;Operating systems;Programming;Real time systems","","","","","","0","","","","","20110601","","VDE","","VDE Conference Publications"

Currently, the automotive industry considers the replacement of mechanical or hydraulic implementations of safety-critical automotive systems (e.g., braking, steering) by electronic counterparts (so-called ""by-wire systems"") for safety, comfort, and cost reasons. In order to remain operational in the presence of faults, these kinds of systems are built as fault-tolerant distributed real-time systems consisting of interconnected control units. To assure the correct operation of the fault tolerance mechanisms, software implemented fault injection provides low cost and easy to control techniques to test the system under faulty conditions. In this paper we propose a distributed software implemented fault injection framework based on the mobile agent approach. Software agents are designed to utilize the real-time system's global time and messages to trigger the fault injection experiments. We introduce a lightweight agent implementation language to model the fault injection and the concerned system resources, agent migration and logging of the fault injection experiments.","","0-7695-2056-1","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265708","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Costs;Electronics industry;Fault tolerant systems;Microprocessors;Mobile agents;Real time systems;Software safety","mobile agents;safety-critical software;software fault tolerance","automotive industry;by-wire systems;distributed software implemented fault injection;drive-by-wire application;electronic devices;fault injection software;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant distributed real-time systems;lightweight agent implementation language;mobile agents;real-time system;safety;safety-critical automotive systems;safety-critical distributed systems;software agents","","","","2","","","","","20040226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This extension is realized by a UML profile. A model-based approach is presented aiming at the definition of a so-called Application Replication View, in which a replication strategy is specified for safety critical application components. A separate model, called Application Timing View, defines timing constraints for system responses. The combination of the two views will enable schedulability analysis of the fault-tolerant application. Schedulability analysis considers the task set composed of application tasks and the additional tasks injected by replication.

Without an upfront agreement between the system supplier and the certifier about the necessary evidence to collect, omissions invariably occur and must be remedied after the fact and at significant costs. The authors present a flexible approach and a supporting tool for assisting suppliers and certifiers in developing an agreement about the evidence necessary to demonstrate compliance to a safety standard.

In addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the approach. The contribution of the approach is threefold. First, the approach applies the theory of model-based design with OSEK/VDX standard in automotive electronics domain.

New design trends and the ongoing work in the AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) partnership have significantly increased the industry's awareness to these issues. Now, timing is recognized as a major challenge and has been put explicitly on the agenda of AUTOSAR and other industry-driven research projects. The goals include complementing the existing standard by a timing view and adding methodological steps, if necessary. Clearly, establishing such timing models requires knowing well the implications of modern architectures and topologies. In this paper, we survey existing performance analysis approaches from real-time systems research and compare them to the established layered software architectures of automotive system design. We highlight key challenges for the application of performance analysis in this domain and identify structural as well as behavioral ldquomodeling gapsrdquo. While structural gaps can be overcome by model transformations, behavioral gaps require real extensions to known analyses. We discuss two such extensions in detail, namely, the use of hierarchical event models and the specialties of timing analysis for multicore platforms.

The major challenges in the automotive test data management domain include coping with a huge amount of data produced, considering their long lifetime, and trying to re-use as much as possible of the already acquired knowledge. For this purpose the automotive standards organization ASAM (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) has specified a storage standard called Open Data Services (ODS), which allows users to design data models fitted to their specific needs while keeping general classification information for generic use. On the other hand, object oriented concepts have evolved in the software technology domain, and UML has emerged as the most important standard to specify software-based systems. Given the similarities between the goals of ODS and aspects of UML that describe the static parts of a software system, this paper proposes a mapping between these two technologies.","","978-1-4673-4567-5","978-1-4673-4568-2","10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505865","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505865","ASAM;UML;automotive testing;data model;meta model;model mapping;standards","","Unified Modeling Language;automotive engineering;data models;object-oriented methods;software reusability;storage management;testing","ASAM automotive standard organization;Association-for-Standardization-of-Automation-and-Measuring Systems;ODS storage standard;Open Data Services;UML;Unified Modeling Language;automotive test data management domain;classification information;data model mapping;design data models;object oriented concepts;software technology domain;software-based systems;standardized automotive testing data storage","","","","0","","8","","","20130422","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper deals with problem of engine calibration, using the minimum of experiments. The approach proposed consists in building a global emulator based on Kriging model, which was adapted to take into account a number of control parameters greater than 3, while existing software are limited to two control parameters. This model is used to predict an engine response, and is coupled with a genetic algorithm, in order to give a best setting of parameters, optimizing the fuel consumption within constraints on the emission of NO<sub>Â¿</sub> (nitrogen oxide).

The anomaly detection framework detects anomalies at two levels: 1) It detects anomalies in repair data using system-level fault model (or fault dependency-matrix) and diagnostic reasoner; 2) It detects anomalies in diagnostic trouble code (DTC) data using operating sensory parameter identifiers (PIDs) data mining. The system-level fault model provides a way to capture causal relationships between failures and symptoms of a given system. A repair is declared as anomalous if it does not match the repair recommended by the fault model and diagnostic reasoner. The PIDs data mining detects anomalies in DTC data by detecting patterns in the associated PIDs using various statistical techniques such as scatter plots, clustering and decision trees. The DTC anomalies could be either due to errors in the preconditions under which the DTCs are designed to set or errors while implementing them in the software. The PIDs data mining module provides a focused feedback to engineers for detecting the errors in DTC software algorithms and enhancing the diagnostic design of DTCs during the early stages of vehicle production.

Fault tolerance is an important aspect of safety. In general, fault tolerance is achieved by duplicating hardware components, a solution that is often more expensive than needed. In applications such as automotive electronics, a subset of the functionalities has to be guaranteed while others are not crucial to the safety of the operation of the vehicle. In this case, we must make sure that this subset is operational under the potential faults of the architecture. A model of computation called fault-tolerant data flow (FTDF) was recently introduced to describe at the highest level of abstraction of the design the fault tolerance requirements on the functionality of the system. Then, the problem of implementing the system efficiently on a platform consists of finding a mapping of the FTDF model on the components of the platform. A complete design flow for this kind of application requires a user-friendly graphical interface to capture the functionality of the systems with the FTDF model, algorithms for choosing an architecture optimally, (possibly automatic) code generation for the parts of the system to be implemented in software and verification tools. In this paper, we use the generic modeling environment (GME) developed at Vanderbilt University to design a graphical design capture system and to provide the infrastructure for automatic code generation. The design flow is embedded into the Metropolis environment developed at the University of California at Berkeley to provide the necessary verification and analysis framework.","","0-7695-2308-0","","10.1109/ECBS.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1409921","","Application software;Computer architecture;Embedded software;Error correction;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Feedback control;Hardware;Software design;Vehicle safety","data flow analysis;embedded systems;formal verification;graphical user interfaces;program compilers;safety-critical software;software architecture;software fault tolerance;software tools","automatic code generation;embedded software;fault-tolerant data flow modeling;generic modeling environment;real-time feedback control application;safety-critical system;user-friendly graphical interface;verification tools","","","","3","","16","","","20050418","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these problems, many approaches exist that focus on modeling these functional dependencies in early stages of system design. However, there are only few empirical studies that report on the extent of such dependencies in industrial software systems and how they are considered in an industrial development context. In this paper, we analyze the functional architecture of a real automotive software system with the aim to assess the extent, awareness and importance of interactions between features of a future vehicle. Our results show that within the functional architecture at least 85% of the analyzed vehicle features depend on each other. They furthermore show that the developers are not aware of a large number of these dependencies when they are modeled solely on an architectural level. Therefore, the developers mention the need for a more precise specification of feature interactions, e.g., for the execution of comprehensive impact analyses. These results challenge the current development methods and emphasize the need for an extensive modeling of features and their dependencies in requirements engineering.","","","","10.1109/RE.2013.6636728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636728","Functional specifications;automotive;empirical studies;feature interaction;model-based development","Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Interviews;Software systems;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","automotive engineering;formal specification;software architecture","automotive software system;feature interactions;functional architecture;functional dependencies;impact analyses;industrial development;industrial software systems;requirements engineering","","","","0","","","","","20131021","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This contrasts with rapid prototyping that typically uses much more powerful hardware than will be used in production. Rapid prototyping allows the designer to evaluate the functional behaviour of embedded software, however, it does not ensure that the final product will satisfy the performance requirements on a resource constrained, mass production embedded microprocessor. By contrast, on-target rapid prototyping additionally allows an assessment of how the automatically generated code will perform on final production hardware. On-target rapid prototyping is being widely adopted in today's automotive and aerospace development processes. The primary technology that enables this is Model-Based Design with automatic production code generation. This session introduces on-target rapid prototyping. It will also discuss modelling and code generation guidelines that help developers transition smoothly from traditional rapid-prototyping to on-target rapid prototyping. Workflow details presented include model conversion from floating-point to fixed-point, data dictionary creation, block and state machine selection, and optimal code generation settings.","","0-86341-609-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123429","","","embedded systems;mass production;production engineering computing;program compilers;rapid prototyping (industrial)","aerospace development processes;automatic production code generation;automotive development processes;embedded control software;embedded software functional behaviour;mass production embedded microprocessor;on-target rapid prototyping","","","","0","","","","","20070312","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

The advent of model-based design methodologies has alleviated some of the verification-related problems by making the code-generation process flow automatically from the model description. Given the relative infancy of this approach, several companies rely upon design flows based on different tools connected together by file transfer. This way of integrating tools defeats the very purpose of the methodology, introducing a high potential of errors in the transformation from one format to another and preventing formal analysis of the properties of the design. We propose to adopt a formal transformation across different tools and we give an example of this approach by linking two tools that are widely used in the automotive domain, Simulink and ASCET.

The goal of this paper is to find a correct placement of software components efficiently, even though most of these individual constraints are highly intractable (NP-complete). This is a prerequisite for runtime adaptation in such domains and can be used for system optimization, extension or failure handling. We introduce an integrated model of system constraints for efficient computation of software component allocation, focusing on automotive embedded systems. For solving these, we have developed and compared two techniques based on SAT solving and Simulated Annealing, which enforce placement constraints efficiently. This reduces the size of the constraints significantly, but still leads to 2 million variables and more than 126 thousand equations in our case study with realistic automotive system settings.

During these modifications, one of the big challenges is ensuring that no new error is introduced. This verification tends to be difficult given that modifying the concurrency structure of an application has multiple side effects difficult to discover. In this paper we propose a model-based technique to compare the concurrency structures of two architectural models. This exhaustive comparison is based on the semantics of AADL, an architecture description language, and its model in Alloy, a formal verification language.

As the product development requires shorter lead-time and faster response for the market demand, closed communication and collaboration is required. In traditional way of engineering, each system is commonly operated in isolated environment, and efficient communication with each other is difficult to achieve. This causes waste of investment on the hardware, software, human resources, and also causes inefficiency in the product development and production. PLM(Product Lifecycle Management) and new IT(Information Technology) are the most powerful approaches to solve these problems. PLM is one of innovative manufacturing paradigms which leverage e-business technologies to allow a companypsilas product content to be developed and integrated with all company business process through the extended enterprise. For the successful achievement to PLM, the management, creation, collaboration of all product and manufacturing related information is essential, and the exchange of product information is core part of PLM business process. This paper proposes the methodology and prototype system for product information exchanges and integrated managements in automotive supply network. This approach architected by using ooCBD(object oriented component-based development) which can analyze and refine from the use case model to implementation test. Then, we define a BOM(Bill of Material) neutral file that is XML(eXtensible Mark-up Language) format based on PLM Services standard. PLM Services is an articulate PLM data model schema to exchange product information. Eventually, we implement the software modules to support data exchange between commercial PDM(Product Data Management) systems of diverse suppliers and CAD system. In this research, object CAD/PDM Systems are Teamcenter Engineering, SmarTeam and CATIA. Using this product informati- on exchanges and integrated management in engineering collaboration portal and suggested neutral file for BOM, many engineers in supply network can share their information and knowledge in a fast, integrated and convenient way.","","978-0-7695-3507-4","","10.1109/CSIE.2009.962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170935","CAD(Computer Aided Design);PDM(Product Data Management);PLM(product Lifecycle Management);XML(Extensible Markup Language)","Business;Collaboration;Isolation technology;Knowledge engineering;Manufacturing industries;Manufacturing processes;Portals;Power system management;Product development;Systems engineering and theory","CAD/CAM;automobile industry;electronic commerce;electronic data interchange;groupware;innovation management;product life cycle management","CAD/PDM system;automotive supply network;bill of material;business process;collaboration portal system;data exchange;e-business technology;information technology;innovative manufacturing;product data management system;product development;product information exchange;product lifecycle management;software module","","","","1","","7","","","20090724","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specific classes of software are unable to leverage software instrumentation; e.g., timing for real-time systems, memory consumption for embedded software, and tracing bandwidth for on-board software. We present the first instrumentation framework, INSTEP, that preserves logical correctness and a rich set of extra-functional properties. INSTEP derives instrumentation alternatives based on the developer's instrumentation intent (II), abstracts the program and prunes the search space, and then instruments the program based on constraints and cost models of competing properties.

The advantages of validating the design using high-level models can be lost entirely if errors and modifications that are not back-annotated to the higher abstraction levels are introduced when refining the design to lower levels of abstraction. To overcome this problem and to reduce design time, automatic synthesis has been used for the refinement process from Register Transfer Languages (RTLs) to logic gates for digital circuit design. This approach guarantees (assuming that the synthesis algorithms are correctly implemented) that the semantic of the RTL description is semantically equivalent to the semantic of the logic circuit. Automatic code generation is similar in intent and applicability. However, the software implementation of the abstract model must make efficient use of the platform resources that may not reflect all the assumptions of the code generation algorithms. The implementation of communication in a synchronous reactive model requires buffering and access procedures at the kernel level. In previous work, we obtained tight bounds on the size of communication buffers to maintain semantic equivalence. In realtime systems, however, because of the longer execution times of access procedures, an implementation with minimum buffer size may lead to the violation of deadlines. To solve this problem, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based optimization approach that provides the minimum memory implementation of a set of communication channels while guaranteeing that the task deadline constraints are met. The analysis is validated by an OSEK/VDX-compliant implementation that provides an estimate of actual runtime overheads. The approach is applied to a set of task graphs and an automotive case study.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2010.2064171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559439","Design optimization;OSEK;model-based design;real-time","Design optimization;Embedded systems;Formal verification;High level synthesis;Mixed integer linear programming;Real time systems","formal verification;integer programming;linear programming;logic design;logic gates;program compilers;telecommunication channels;telecommunication computing","abstraction level;code generation;communication buffers;communication channels;communication procedure synthesis;digital circuit design;formal verification;logic gates;mixed integer linear programming;real-time synchronous reactive models;register transfer languages;task deadline constraints","","","","2","","26","","2010-08-30","20101104","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Industrial Applications Society;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society;IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The performance evaluation of a fuel cell system requires both static and dynamic model, especially for the automotive applications which involve step variations of electric load. Besides, current step variations abruptly change the fuel cell voltage causing a non-linear behavior. In this case, a parallel supercapacitor becomes an important element to provide energy during transients. Fuel cell dynamic models presented in literature adopt chemical-physic-electrical parameters that are not usually provided by factories. In this paper, we concern the implementation of dynamic fuel cell model during step current transients from the electrical point of view. The model is used to evaluate the transient performance of the whole system, i.e. fuel cell and supercapacitor, by means of simulation software SIMULINK. Simulation results show gradual variations of fuel cell terminal voltage from initial steady state to final steady state values when a supercapacitor is parallel connected.","","1-4244-0632-3","1-4244-0632-3","10.1109/ICCEP.2007.384251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272422","Fuel Cell;measurement system;supercapacitor","Automotive applications;Fuel cells;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Power generation;Power system modeling;Steady-state;Supercapacitors;Transportation;Vehicle dynamics;Voltage","proton exchange membrane fuel cells;supercapacitors;transients","FC PEM;SIMULINK software;automotive applications;current transients;electric load step variation;parallel supercapacitor;proton exchange membrane fuel cell","","","","1","","7","","","20070716","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we present a unified framework that enables users to create ontologies representing arbitrary domains of interest and analyses over those domains. These analyses may then be run against software specifications, encapsulated as models, checking that they are sound with respect to the given ontology. Our approach is general, in that the framework is agnostic to the semantic meaning of the ontologies that it uses and does not privilege the example ontologies that we present here. Where practical use-cases and principled theory exist, we provide for the expression of certain patterns of infinite ontologies. In this paper we present two patterns of infinite ontologies: those containing values, and those containing ontologies recursively. We show how these two patterns map to use cases of unit systems and structured data types, and show how these are applicable to cyber-physical systems examples drawn from automotive and avionic domains. Despite the range of ontologies and analyses that we present here, we see user-built ontologies as a key feature of our approach.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064508","model engineering;ontologies;static analysis","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Lattices;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Semantics;Unified modeling language","embedded systems;formal verification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program diagnostics","automotive domain;avionic domain;cyber-physical system;embedded software;infinite ontology;model checking;model encapsulation;practical ontology framework;semantic meaning;software specification;static model analysis;structured data type","","","","0","","","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Developments in electronics and mechanics have improved the vehicle performance in collision. Lately several developments on preventing or avoiding collision have raised as active safety systems or so called in Europe, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Systems as adaptive cruise control, lane change assist and blind spot detection have been developed facing the challenge of avoiding collision. In present paper is shown a model of collision avoidance for automotive applications. The system includes a model for vehicle dynamics: it was developed with the causal software AMESIM. Decision functions were developed to determine when an object is a dangerous obstacle, those functions depends on relative speed, and distance between host vehicle and obstacle. Vehicle model and decision functions are integrated to become a system for collision avoidance. The system warns the driver in a distance safe enough to avoid the collision in case the driver neglects warnings, the system begins braking in order to decrease damage severity if the collision happens or even avoid it. The simulation results of selected collision scenarios are presented. Also a brief description of available sensors for this application is shown.","","978-1-4244-1265-5","978-1-4244-1266-2","10.1109/ICVES.2007.4456397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4456397","","Adaptive systems;Collision avoidance;Consumer electronics;Driver circuits;Europe;Injuries;Insurance;Road accidents;Safety;Vehicles","collision avoidance;vehicle dynamics;virtual reality","automotive application;causal software AMESIM;collision avoidance system;collision scenario;decision function;obstacle detection;sensors;vehicle dynamics;vehicle model;virtual model","","","","2","","10","","","20080225","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such systems, requirements are of different nature (software-related, system-related, functional or non functional) and must be traced through a multilevel design flow which integrates multiple tools and heterogeneous models. Validation and Verification (V&V) activities must be performed on models and on the final product to check whether they match the initial requirements. Results of design and V&V activities must be able to impact traceability information. We thus propose DARWIN4REQ, a metamodel for requirement traceability, based on three independent flows (requirement model, solution model and V&V model). The new metamodel establishes a link between these flows and affords full traceability of requirements, including those set for heterogeneous models. This paper presents the DARWIN4REQ metamodel and its use in the context of heterogeneous models for requirements modeling, design and V&V. An automotive application illustrates the proposed approach based on UML-profiles such that SYSML, EAST-ADL2 and MARTE for design and on SIMULINK, SyNDEx and TIMESQUARE for V&V activities.","","978-1-4244-6638-2","978-1-4244-6639-9","10.1109/ICECCS.2010.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628611","Requirement modeling;automotive application.;model-based design;real-time embedded systems;traceability model;validation and verification","Adaptation model;Automotive engineering;Context modeling;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Safety;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;automotive engineering;embedded systems;program verification","DARWIN4REQ metamodel;EAST-ADL2;MARTE;SIMULINK;SYSML;SyNDEx;TIMESQUARE;UML-profiles;automotive embedded system;heterogeneous model-based design process;multilevel design flow;real-time embedded design process;requirements traceability modeling;validation activity;verification activity","","","","1","","","","","20101111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To make sure that safety-critical systems are really safe, only using the traditional methods is not enough. Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) method is becoming the mainstream as the instrument of the people. Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is a modeling language standard brought forward by the Society of Automotive Engineers, Avionics Systems Division, et al, is becoming a research topic for many organizations and institutes. It is a kind of MDA method also. For safety-critical systems, we must verify all the important properties whatever the method we use. Among the properties, the schedulability problem is a very important problem in the real-time software. But, how to solve the schedulability problem in a practical AADL project is a new obstacle to us. In this paper, we use the linear hybrid automata to abstract the semantics of the software components explicitly, then try to use TIMES tool developed by Uppsala Univ and Furness tool developed by Fremont Associates, LLC to simulate the semantics of linear hybrid automata and the scheduling execution trace of AADL software components respectively.

This is usually the case for languages as well. This reflection becomes particularly relevant for validation tools, since the validation process is closely related to requirements. Therefore, test engineers must work at a much lower level of abstraction than that of the system domain. The problem is especially relevant when dealing with complex systems, in which hardware and software are closely related, such as ambient intelligence systems, automotive, power plants, telecommunication and autonomic systems in general. The authors of this paper claim that validation tools can and will be domain specific in the future. For this reason, they will have to include knowledge defined in the system requirements. As explained within this paper, this knowledge can be incorporated into the validation tools with limited involvement from the test engineer. These domain specific-tools will make the task easier for test engineers. This paper analyzes the different kinds of knowledge involved in domain-specific validation tools, specifically acceptance testing tools. The knowledge is expressed in terms of requirements and models. This paper also presents a model driven engineering approach to derive validation tools and environments from system models. This approach uses model transformations. Derivation can be performed in either a semiautomatic or fully automatic way depending on the system characteristics. Through these approaches, software and systems engineers can access to domain-specific validation tools during the early stages of the system life cycle.","","9781-4244-1327-0","978-1-4244-1328-7","10.1109/COGINF.2007.4341915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341915","MDA;MDE;acceptance testing;acceptance testing environments;domain specific validation environment;model transformation;test automation;test tools;tool generation","Ambient intelligence;Automotive engineering;Hardware;Knowledge engineering;Model driven engineering;Power engineering and energy;Power generation;Reflection;Software systems;System testing","program testing;program verification;software tools","abstraction;acceptance testing tools;application domain;languages;model driven engineering;software engineering;system life cycle;system requirements;validation tools","","","","2","","52","","","20071008","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regarding hybrid or electrical vehicles the dissipated thermal power of these new functions can be significant. Therefore, the thermal analysis is now essential for peak and thermal cycle amplitudes prediction which are the main driving factors for equipment reliability. The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Software is becoming increasingly common to perform this kind of analysis. Unfortunately, when quick response is needed to trade off between several design solutions, when complex power profiles have to be addressed or when non linear effects of temperature have to be considered in power loss prediction (electro-thermal simulation), the CFD solution is sometimes of little help. The paper describes a methodology which allows to perform a thermal analysis in a reduced time. Simulation time reduction is based on simplification of the thermal model by focusing analysis on a reduced number of points (power injection points and observed temperatures). 3D model using millions of cells is converted into a “0D” or “mesh less” model using a few tens of points.","","978-1-61284-814-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730668","","Analytical models;Computational fluid dynamics;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;SPICE;Temperature sensors;Transfer functions","automobile industry;automotive electronics;hybrid electric vehicles;reliability;road safety;thermal analysis","3D model;CFD software;automotive industry;computational fluid dynamics;embedded electronic functions;equipment reliability;fuel consumption reduction;hybrid or electrical vehicles;nonlinear temperature effects;power loss prediction;road car safety;simulation time reduction;thermal cycle amplitude prediction;thermal model analysis;thermal power dissipation;thermal pre-dimensioning methodology","","","","0","","4","","","20110314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This architecture offers a network independent interface and adapted real-time system and transport services while taking into account the constraints of automotive applications in terms of size and cost. It lies upon the specification of three standards defining respectively an operating system, a communication model and network management facilities. This approach is a major step for the on-board vehicle networking since it eases the application portability and the equipment interoperability, and it avoids the costly development of proprietary solutions. The success of this initiative will clearly depend on the level of confidence in the products implementing the OSEK/VDX standards and potentially designed by different third parties in a totally open market. Therefore, to impede the emergence of a large variety of non-compliant implementations, there is a need to specify conformance tests and develop the corresponding tools, able to assess products' conformity to the OSEK/VDX specification. Another key to a successful application of the OSEK/VDX layered model is the vertical integration of hardware, software and system aspects. The quality of the validation process during integration is of prior importance since it guarantees the safety of mass applications involving human beings.

In this paper, a modeling tool that has been developed to study automotive systems using the power electronics simulator (PSIM) software is presented. PSIM was originally made for simulating power electronic converters and motor drives. This user-friendly simulation package is able to simulate electric/electronic circuits; however, it has no capability for simulating the entire system of an automobile. This paper discusses the PSIM validity as an automotive simulation tool by creating module boxes for not only the electrical systems, but also the mechanical, energy-storage, and thermal systems of the vehicles. These modules include internal combustion engines, fuel converters, transmissions, torque couplers, and batteries.

The need for efficient development cycles prohibits extensive manual reviews, however. To overcome this problem, the combination of different software verification techniques has been suggested in the literature. Following this direction, we present a novel approach combining abstract interpretation and source code bounded model checking, where the model checker is used to reduce the number of false error reports.

In the calculation, the contact forms of forces and the relative movement between piston and piston pin are described with contact pairs and analyzed with the augmented Lagrange method. Calculating results indicates that the maximum stress concentration is at the upper end of piston pin boss inner hole, and is mainly caused by the peak pressure of the fuel gas.

In the process of suspension design, ride comfort and handing stability are two conflicting considerations. Magneto-rheological(MR) fluid dampers are a new class of devices that more suitable for the requirements of automotive applications, including having very low power requirements. According to different driving conditions and body posture, semi-active suspension based on MR damper can coordinate the body posture angle, and reduce the vibration from suspension pass to vehicle body. This paper deals with theoretical analysis and experiments of MR fluid damper in semi-active suspension system. Based on a large number of experimental data, a mathematical MR damper model was adopted to predict both the force-displacement behavior and the complex nonlinear force-velocity response. For the purpose of developing semi-active controller, a detailed vehicle Virtual Prototyping model with steering, frame and semi-active suspensions systems was established by vehicle dynamics simulation software SIMPACK. The co-simulation of ride comfort and handing stability showed that the semi-active suspension designed in this paper was suitable for solving the conflict between ride comfort and handing stability, and improve the ride and handing performance simultaneously.","2157-9555","978-1-4244-9950-2","","10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6022298","Magneto-rheological fluid damper;handing stability;ride comfort;semi-active suspension","Acceleration;Mathematical model;Shock absorbers;Stability analysis;Vehicles;Virtual prototyping","automobile industry;magnetorheology;mechanical engineering computing;suspensions (mechanical components);vehicle dynamics;vibrations;virtual prototyping","SIMPACK;automotive applications;complex nonlinear force-velocity response;force-displacement behavior;handing stability;magneto-rheological fluid dampers;mathematical MR damper model;optimization;ride comfort;semiactive suspension;suspension design;vehicle dynamics simulation software;vehicle features;vehicle virtual prototyping model","","","","0","","10","","","20110919","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional development processes depend heavily on actual engine and vehicle testing, which means that control logic design can not start before the hardware is completed. And when performance is not sufficient, hardware and control design iteration is required. To shorten the development period, concurrent development of hardware and software is effective. Moreover, the control logic complexity is becoming higher in accordance with the implementation of new sensors, actuators, and improved control system performance. In turn, this increased complexity results in a huge control logic parameter calibration task. Various studies that use modeling to reduce calibration measurements have been tried. To expand MBD throughout our development process, we require that models are developed in a rapid and timely manner. In this paper, we discuss the concepts of MBD and concurrent development, and introduce some example applications. We also describe some key points for efficient model development.","","978-7-81124-055-9","978-7-900719-22-5","10.1109/CHICC.2006.4347173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4347173","Hardware-in-loop;Model based development","Automotive engineering;Calibration;Control design;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Engines;Hardware;Logic design;Logic testing;Vehicles","automotive engineering;concurrent engineering;engines;formal specification","concurrent development;control logic complexity;control logic design;control logic parameter calibration;control system development;engine development;model based development","","","","0","","8","","","20071015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The output of the algorithm is a set of open loop test input functions which represent a minimal set of test scenarios required to determine with within some confidence interval if the system meets the specification. The primary motivation behind developing such a method is to avoid the time, expense and inconclusiveness of trial an error testing by using automated rigorous tools to guide the design process.

Because of its time-triggered message scheduling, it is regarded as the basis for applications like drive-by-wire. In order to fulfill the associated safety requirements, a reliable membership service is mandatory for providing consensus on all fault-free nodes. However, the FlexRay specification misses to define such a service. Consequently, it is not a part of the communication controllers but has to be realized in the software that is executed by the ECUs. This paper proposes a membership protocol especially tailored for FlexRay-based distributed systems such as envisioned by the AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) standard. It features low runtime overhead and imposes small scheduling restrictions on the ECU.

A numerical solution of temperature as function of time is formulated upon which a simple computer code is written to obtain transient behavior of a system or components. Based on the lumped capacitance (LC) model, a general average power concept is presented to obtain a steady state solution from finite element modeling (FEM). The steady state solution is then used to evaluate the time constant for analysis of transient heat transfer. The transient solutions from the proposed model and those obtained from FEA show good agreement at component level. Time to transient solution of a wire resistor only takes a couple of seconds via the proposed approach while it took four hours on HP735 for the first 120 cycles.

Component-to-ECU mapping is conventionally done manually and empirically. As the number of components and ECUs in vehicles systems grows rapidly, it becomes infeasible to find optimal solutions by hand. We address some design issues involved in mapping an AUTOSAR model to a distributed hardware platform with multiple ECUs connected by a bus, each ECU running a real-time operating system. We present algorithms for extracting connectivity between ports of atomic software components from an AUTOSAR model and for calculating blocking times of all tasks of a taskset scheduled by PCP. We then address optimization issues in mapping AUTOSAR components (SWCs) to distributed multithreaded implementations. We formulate and solve two optimization problems: map SWCs to ECUs with the objective of minimizing the bus load; for a given SWC-to-ECU mapping, map runnable entities on each ECU to OS tasks and assign data consistency mechanism to each shared data item to minimize memory size requirement on each ECU while guaranteeing schedulability of tasksets on all ECUs.","Pending","978-1-4577-0658-5","978-1-4577-0659-2","10.1109/RSP.2011.5929971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929971","ECU;data consistency;schedulability;software component","Assembly;Automotive engineering;Clustering algorithms;Connectors;Memory management;Optimization;Software","automotive electronics;embedded systems;multi-threading;operating systems (computers);optimisation;scheduling;simulation languages;software architecture","AUTOSAR model;atomic software component;automotive embedded system;automotive open system architecture;automotive software development;component-based modeling language;component-to-ECU mapping;distributed hardware platform;distributed multithreaded implementation;optimization problem;real-time operating system","","","","0","","6","","","20110623","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these scenarios of increasing complexity, it is paramount for the designer to try different implementations quickly in terms of software distribution and communication protocols, so as to satisfy the requirements of cost, real time and safety.

Meanwhile, different material constitutive relations for die attach were investigated. For the energy-based life prediction method, Darveaux's fatigue prediction model was implemented to calculate the thermal cycles for crack initiation and propagation, based on the inelastic strain energy density accumulated per cycle during thermal cycling. At the same time, the effective strain method based on creep mechanism was used for comparison with the results from energy-based method. In the implementation of the effective strain method, a FORTRAN subroutine of material constitutive model were developed to couple with the finite element simulation software ANSYS<sup>®</sup>. In addition, the solder joint fatigue life of low-temperature sintered Nano-silver material was simulated by using both methods.

In the system level, the downstream converter behaves as a constant power load (CPL) which shows negative incremental resistance and may cause negative impedance instability in the system. In addition, there is no general model for large signal stability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. In view of the above, this paper set up a reduced order large signal model for the step-down cascaded system first, and analyzes the stability of converters with CPL based on Lyapunov stability theory.

The performance of these systems is closely related to the quality of the processed wheel speed. However, due to manufacturing tolerances or corrosion respectively of the sensor gear wheel, the quality of the signal is affected negatively. In this paper a software-based method to compensate for the mechanical inaccuracy of the sensor wheel is introduced. The approach increases the signal accuracy of conventional automotive wheel-speed sensors significantly. Moreover, with the presented method, the demand for manufacturing precision of the sensor wheel is reduced, which in turn cuts down the costs for mass production considerably. The correction is obtained by online learning of a correction factor for each sensor impulse using a fuzzy model for reconstructing the actual wheel-speed and recursive parameter identification for estimating the correction factors. A method to determine the angular position of the gear wheel without a reference impulse is proposed.

"A Light-Weight Defect Classification Scheme for Embedded Automotive Software and Its Initial Evaluation","Mellegard, N.; Staron, M.; Torner, F.","","Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE), 2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on","27-30 Nov. 2012","2012","","","261","270","Objective: Defect classification is an essential part of software development process models as a means of early identification of patterns in defect inflow profiles. Such classification, however, may often be a tedious task requiring analysis work in addition to what is necessary to resolve the issue. To increase classification efficiency, adapted schemes are needed. In this paper a light-weight defect classification scheme adapted for minimal process footprint -- in terms of learning and classification effort -- is proposed and initially evaluated. Method: A case study was conducted at Volvo Car Corporation to adapt the IEEE Std. 1044 for automotive embedded software. An initial evaluation was conducted by applying the adapted scheme to defects from an existing software product with industry professionals as subjects. Results: The results showed that the classification scheme was quick to learn and understand -- required classification time stabilized around 5-10 minutes already after practicing on 3-5 defects. The results also showed that the patterns in the classified defects were interesting for the professionals, although in order to apply statistical methods more data was needed. Conclusions: We conclude that the adapted classification scheme captures what is currently tacit knowledge and has the potential of revealing patterns in the defects detected in different project phases. Furthermore, we were, in the initial evaluation, able to contribute with new information about the development process. As a result we are currently in the process of incorporating the classification scheme into the company's defect reporting system.","1071-9458","978-1-4673-4638-2","","10.1109/ISSRE.2012.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405374","Modeling;Software defect analysis;Software engineering;Software metrics;Software quality;Software reliability","Companies;Context;Documentation;IEEE standards;Safety;Software;Testing","IEEE standards;automobiles;automotive engineering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software quality;software reliability;statistical analysis","IEEE 1044 standard;Volvo Car Corporation;classification time stabilization;company defect reporting system;defect inflow profiles;embedded automotive software evaluation;learning time;light-weight defect classification efficiency enhancement;minimal process footprint;pattern classification;pattern identification;software development process models;software product;statistical methods","","","","0","","24","","","20130404","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This allows to reduced driver workload and also supports automatic apply/release features. This paper discusses a development of an EPB control model that comprises the high level functional software algorithms to control the operation of the remote EPB actuator. The objective is to improve and extend the existing system functionality employing feature enhancements via in-house development. The control strategy utilised in the model development involves implementation of the safety requirements, vehicle attribute estimation, driver presence detection, diagnostics and fault reaction strategy. The latter is presented in the context of a drive away release (DAR) function, an automatic release feature determined based upon detection of driver intention to drive.

Device degradation, due to temperature or voltage stress, causes a shift of device parameters, for example threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>, which can also be modeled as a degradation of transistor parameters. Therefore, in order to design circuits, which are robust and reliable, analysis and optimization of their sensitivity to variations in model parameters is important. Furthermore, constraints on the operating regions and voltage differences of transistors are used in order to keep operating points stable over a large temperature range. In this work, using two circuits for automotive applications and current process development kits (PDK), we show how design centering software can be used to consider both sensitivity reduction towards model parameter variation and constraints to control safe operating areas (SOA). Beyond that a comparison of the constraint matrix method with two established methods of SOA checking is done.","","978-0-7695-3117-5","","10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479849","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479849","Automotive;Constraint Matrix;Design Centering;OTA;Reliability;Safe Operating Area;Self-Biasing Cascode;WiCKeD","Automotive applications;Circuit simulation;Degradation;Design optimization;Manufacturing processes;Robustness;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Stress;Temperature sensors;Threshold voltage","automotive electronics;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability","automotive applications;constraint matrix method;design centering;device degradation;device parameters;manufacturing process;model parameter variation;process development kits;robust analog design;safe operating areas;sensitivity reduction;temperature stress;threshold voltage;transistor parameters;voltage differences;voltage stress","","","","2","","24","","","20080331","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Control theorists design the control laws to be robust with respect to the former kind of faults while assuming an idealized scenario for the latter. The execution platforms supporting modern real-time embedded systems, however, are distributed architectures made of heterogeneous components that may incur transient or permanent faults. Making the platform fault tolerant involves the introduction of design redundancy with obvious impact on the final cost. We present a design flow that enables the efficient exploration of redundancy/cost tradeoffs. After providing a system-level specification of the target platform and the fault model, designers can rely on the synthesis of the low-level fault-tolerance mechanisms. This is performed automatically as part of the embedded software deployment through the combination of the following three steps: replication, mapping, and scheduling. Our approach has a sound foundation in fault-tolerant data flow, a novel model of computation that simplifies the integration of formal validation techniques.

At the same time, platform FPGAs are a natural technology for implementing computationally intensive systems in the aerospace, automotive and industrial domains, as they combine high performance and flexibility with lower non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs when compared to low-volume ASIC solutions. The reusability and portability of hardware components in these safety-critical domains could be significantly improved by using multithreaded programming. However, the unique design considerations for memory virtualization, as required in safety-critical systems, are difficult to transfer directly from software to autonomous hardware threads. This paper presents a transparent and efficient way of augmenting current multithreaded and partially reconfigurable hardware runtime environments with dedicated, hardware-thread-aware memory address translation units to provide seamless memory translation for hardware threads.

This gives rise to a challenge to a well-working communication systems in handling the V2X radio channel. The two most important components influencing the channel are the antennas and the fast changing environment, resulting in a time-variant behavior of the channel. Therefore, finding the optimal antenna configuration to ensure the best performance is a difficult task. A possible solution is the employment of measurement campaigns, but they are expensive, time consuming, and provide no repeatability. An alternative approach, based on simulations, is presented in this article. This tool, called “Virtual Drive,” consists of an environment and a traffic model and calculates the multipath propagation with a 3D ray-tracing tool. This combination yields a “virtual drive” through arbitrary scenarios and allows for the optimization of antenna configurations that are to be investigated. The different components of the Virtual Drive are described and the accuracy of the software tool is examined by a comparison with measurements. Finally, the manifold capabilities of such a software tool are demonstrated using the example of vehicular antenna optimization for cars and of radar system optimization.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2124430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5776639","C2X;V2X;diversity;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);ray-tracing;vehicular antennas;virtual drive","Antennas;Channel models;Intelligent vehicles;Optimization;Road transportation;Scattering;Solid modeling;Virtual environment","antenna arrays;mobile radio;optimisation;radar;ray tracing","3D ray-tracing tool;V2X communication;V2X radio channel;environment model;multipath propagation;multiple antenna system optimisation;radar system simulator;software tool;traffic model;vehicular antenna optimization;virtual drive","","","","3","","66","","2011-05-27","20110616","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To enable the test engineer of creating data analyses we built a component-based library on top of the languages System{C}/C++. Problematic with this approach is that still substantial programming knowledge is required for implementing filter algorithms, which is usually not the domain of a vehicle test engineer. In a next step we developed a graphical modelling language on top of our library and a graphical editor. The editor is able of verifying a model as well as of generating source code which eliminates the need of manually implementing a filter algorithm.

Although the core of modern vehicle engines is managed by the control software embedded in engine ECUs, no practical approach has been proposed so far to characterise the impact of faults on the behaviour of this software. This paper proposes a dependability benchmark for engine control applications. The essential features of such type of applications are first captured in a general model, which is then exploited in order to specify a standard procedure to assess dependability measures. These measures are defined taking into account the expectations of industrials purchasing engine ECUs with integration purposes. The benchmark also considers the current set of technological limitations that the manufacturing of modern engine ECUs imposes to the experimental process.

To increase the quality, the reliability, and the efficiency of the models and the generated code, checking and elimination of detected guideline violations defined in huge catalogues has become an essential task in the development process. It represents such a tremendous amount of boring work that it must necessarily be automated. In the past we have shown that graph transformation tools like Fujaba/MOFLON allow for the specification of single modeling guidelines on a very high level of abstraction and that guideline checking tools can be generated from these specifications easily. Unfortunately, graph transformation languages do not offer appropriate concepts for reuse of specification fragments - a MUST, when we deal with hundreds of guidelines. As a consequence we present an extension of MOFLON that supports the definition of generic rewrite rules and combines them with the reflective programming mechanisms of Java and the model repository interface standard JMI.","1943-6092","978-1-4244-2528-0","978-1-4244-2529-7","10.1109/VLHCC.2008.4639088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4639088","","Automotive engineering;Computer industry;Guidelines;Java;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Software standards;Software tools;Standards development","Java;formal verification;graph grammars;rewriting systems","JMI standard;Java;MOFLON;graph transformation;model checking;model repository interface;modeling guideline;rewrite rules","","","","0","","15","","","20081007","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

They involve an interplay between embedded systems, control theory, real-time systems and software engineering. A very good example of cyber-physical systems design arises in the context of automotive architectures and software. Modern high-end cars have 50-100 processors or electronic control units (ECUs) that communicate over a network of buses such as CAN and FlexRay. In such complex settings, traditional control-theoretic approaches - where control engineers are only concerned with high-level plant and controller models - start breaking down. This is because implementation-level realities such as message delay, jitter, and task execution times are not adequately considered when designing the controller. Hence, it is becoming necessary to adopt a more holistic, cyber-physical systems design approach where the semantic gap between high-level control models and their actual implementations on multiprocessor automotive platforms is quantified and consciously closed. In this paper we give several examples on how this may be done and the current research challenges in this area that are being faced by the academia and the industry.","","978-1-4673-2295-9","978-1-4673-2296-6","10.1109/SAMOS.2012.6404199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404199","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Delay;Mathematical model;Schedules;Space exploration","automobiles;automotive electronics;control engineering computing;controller area networks;multiprocessing systems;software engineering","CAN;ECU;FlexRay;automotive architecture;automotive cyber-physical systems design;automotive software;bus network;computational units;control theory;controller design;electronic control unit;embedded system;high-end car;high-level control model;jitter;message delay;multiprocessor automotive platform;real-time system;semantic gap;software engineering;task execution time","","","","0","","15","","","20130110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is further impacted by the current trend in automotive industry to replace mechanical and hydraulic system with their electrical counterparts. The handling capability of the current 14V DC system is getting very close to reaching the limits. To meet the new growing electrical power demands with minimum fuel consumption and minimum environmental effects, the automobile industry is looking into increasing the present voltage threefold, from 14V to 42V for future cars. A shift towards a 42V system will cut the current of the vehicle by a factor of three. With the lower current, the size and cost of power semiconductors can be reduced, allowing for their use in applications that could not use semiconductors before. In this paper, a detailed mathematical model for a 3-phase, 4kW and 42V Lundell alternator average electrical equivalent circuit will be presented along with the DC/DC converter based architectures for dual-voltage systems. The performance of the 42V Lundell alternator with the interleaved six-phase buck dc-to-dc converter system is modelled using Simulink software to assess the effectiveness of the model and its transient behaviour.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-815-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383634","42V power system architecture;Dual-voltage electrical power system;MatlabSimulink;automotive;dc-to-dc power modules;power generation","","","","","","","1","","","","","20071119","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

In addition, scheduling policies and parameters, both for the ECUs and the buses, need to be specified. Code generation/optimization from the Simulink/Stateflow models, task partitioning and mapping decisions, as well as the parameters chosen for the schedulers - all of these impact the execution times and timing behaviour of the control tasks and control messages.

Therefore, two independent groups of reviewers were analyzing the same piece of code (conventional C-programs developed in the automotive industry for gear unit control), where one of the groups deployed the semi-automated approach and the other group used the traditional manual technique. The resulting empirical data were analyzed by means of software metrics and software reliability modeling.

Our approach is based on symbolic transition systems (STSs) and overcomes the intricacies resulting from straightforward application of enumerative test models (e.g. state space explosion). The derivation of the test sequences is performed by searching paths through the STS models with respect to their communication structure. By calculating the weakest preconditions of these paths the validity of the paths (and their related parameters) is ensured.

Therefore, in order to design circuits, which are robust and reliable, analysis and optimization of their sensitivity to variations in model parameters is important. Furthermore, constraints on the operating regions and voltage differences of transistors are used in order to keep operating points stable over a large temperature range. In this work, using two circuits for automotive applications and current process development kits (PDK), we show how design centering software can be used to consider both sensitivity reduction towards model parameter variation and constraints to control safe operating areas (SOA).

Interfaces between software and hardware components (SW/HW interfaces) play a fundamental role in these systems by linking the systems' control software to either the physical hardware components or to a hardware abstraction layer. Subsequently, safety certification of embedded systems necessarily has to cover the SW/HW interfaces used in these systems. In this paper, we describe a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach based on the SysML language, targeted at facilitating the certification of SW/HW interfaces in embedded systems. Our work draws on our experience with maritime and energy systems, but the work should also apply to a broader set of domains, e.g., the automotive sector, where similar design principles are used for (SW/HW) interface design.

Our experience indicates that (a) both the specification and verification of even such small code can be hard to automate and needs intense manual effort, and (b) verifying certain optimizations to an existing code is relatively easier. It took us 10 days to specify and 5 days verify the correctness of this 200 line program. Our initial attempt to verify the correctness, using the model checker CBMC, did not scale up due to a huge loop unwinding (220 times). Since it is hard to scale model checking for such huge loops, we first verified each function's correctness independently using CBMC and then verified the correctness of the loop through manual application of induction using CBMC. This traditional modular and inductive approach helped CBMC verify the implementation within 25 seconds. Furthermore, the implementation was poorly coded to begin with and had to undergo several optimizations to meet its performance requirement. With our optimizations, the CRC implementation met its performance requirement. Due to the changes in code for the optimizations, we needed to reverify the complete implementation. To lessen the verification rework, we proved one optimization at a time, in each function, by proving that the behavior of the function is preserved by the optimization. It took us 7 days to code the optimizations and 1 day to verify them. This optimized correct implementation was accepted and shipped by our client along with the client's automotive software. In future, we would like to generalize this approach to verify behavior preserving changes, and we believe that some of these steps can be automated.","","978-1-4577-0019-4","978-0-7695-4345-1","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954468","code;evolution;scalability;verification","Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Generators;Manuals;Optimization;Polynomials;Software","cyclic redundancy check codes;formal specification;program verification","CBMC model checker;automotive software;code optimization;code specification;code verification;correctness verification;cyclic redundancy check;formal verification;inductive approach;industrial C implementation;modular approach","","","","0","","10","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A kind of dual control algorithm is proposed in the paper. That means in the large-signal control mode as start-up period of throttle valve from zero, the entire system is regarded as linear and the response is determined by the PID controller; while in the small-signal control mode during running time, the nonlinear friction and spring force compensator and air disturbance has the dominant influence on the control system behavior. Then it substitutes the original control models on Matlab/Simulink platform combined with the models from Xilinx Blockset library, and simulates the system simultaneously by software and co-hardware to verify the design.

This paper deals with the application of glass encapsulated magnetic reed switches as the telemetry indicator in space mechanisms, specifically after they have been exposed to pyroshocks environment. The reed switch as a telemetry indicator in space mechanisms application has to survive a mechanical shocks environment that exceeds the standard allowable. Reed switches are usually rated to survive, without false operation of the contacts, mechanical shocks levels of up to 100 g for SPST type and up to 50 g for SPDT type. In space applications, the mechanical shock levels are much higher, with peak accelerations of 2,000g to 3,000g and the frequency content much more complex (Pyroshocks are usually expressed in terms of the Shock Response Spectrum-SRS with frequency content up to 10,000 Hz). The reed switch has to be protected against these high loads by adequate mounting impedance of the printed circuit board (PCB) and device housing to the base plate. This requires an accurate 3D FEM Analysis of the reed switch, PCB and device housing. In this work, two methods were used to derive the loads acting on the reed switch during Pyroshocks: the first method employed a Shocks Response Analysis consisting from a Modal Analysis, using IDEAS 12.0 and Model Solution solver to obtain the modal solutions of the reed switch-PCB-Housing assembly, followed by the Response Analysis where the equations of motion are written in terms of the modal Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF), and the physical responses are recovered from modal responses. Because the peak acceleration information only is retained via the SRS, the Shock Response Analysis has to employ a rule to combine the peak loads (accelerations, stresses, elemental forces, etc) generated- - for each of the dynamic modes. The software offers 5 choices of such rules: the absolute value rule ABS; the square root of the sum of squares rule - SRSS; the Naval Research Lab rule - NRL; the complete quadratic combination rule - CQC and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission rule - NRC. All rules have been used and compared. The second method is based on Transient Analysis and it was used to derive the loads on the reed switch during Pyroshocks for a time domain realization of the SRS spectrum. This method can be used post test to analyze the stress induced in the reed switch contacts, leads and glass capsule by a certain Pyroshocks event or prior to the test by generating analytically a time domain realization of the SRS spectrum. The FEM results are compared with experimental data in order to predict the main failure modes of the reed switch: contact surface damage resulting in contact resistance deterioration, contact reset that modifies the pull-in/drop-out points and, in extreme cases, change of the state of the contacts, micro cracks in the glass seal, broken leads, etc.","1062-6808","978-1-4244-8174-3","","10.1109/HOLM.2010.5619475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5619475","","Contacts;Electric shock;Electromagnetic waveguides;Finite element methods;Glass;Load modeling;Switches","electrical contacts;finite element analysis;magnetic switching;microcracks;printed circuits;reed relays;telemetry","3D finite element analysis;Bell Labs;IDEAS 12.0;Naval Research Lab rule;Nuclear Regulatory Commission rule;complete quadratic combination rule;contact surface damage;glass encapsulated magnetic reed switches;mechanical shocks levels;microcracks;modal analysis;mounting impedance;printed circuit board;pyroshock environment;shock response spectrum-SRS;space mechanisms;telemetry indicator;transient analysis","","","","0","","14","","","20101109","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To close the gap between raising complexity and cutting costs, upcoming software standards like AUTOSAR introduce a clear separation of concerns into their system architecture. An AUTOSAR application is built from components that deal with business logic only whereas infrastructural services are provided by standardized middleware. Unfortunately, this middleware tends to be heavy-weight due to its coarse-grained layered design. By applying a component based design to AUTOSAR's middleware, a custom-tailored version for each specific application and system node can be built to overcome this problem. This paper demonstrates how to automatically synthesize component based middleware via the connector transformation: component connectors in platform independent application models are utilized to automatically assemble platform- and application specific middleware. As a result, AUTOSAR middleware becomes custom-tailored and hence light-weight and flexible. In addition, the described synthesis algorithm is capable of incorporating timing annotations via interface contracts at model level, and thus reflects upcoming ambitions to cover real-time constraints at middleware level within AUTOSAR. To prove our approach we successfully synthesized middleware for a demonstrator application and compared it to its conventional counterpart.","1555-0885","978-0-7695-3573-9","","10.1109/ISORC.2009.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5231999","AUTOSAR;CBSE;MDD;Middleware;Model Transformation;Synthesis","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Connectors;Costs;Embedded system;Manufacturing;Middleware;Real time systems;Software standards","automobile industry;automotive engineering;embedded systems;middleware;object-oriented programming;software architecture","AUTOSAR basic software;business logic;coarse-grained layered design;component based middleware-synthesis;connector transformation;distributed real-time automotive embedded system","","","","0","","20","","","20090904","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The enhanced activity diagrams of UML 2 offer a promising intuitive modeling approach for requirements capturing. On this basis, we propose a formal syntax and operational semantics and extend activity diagrams to LADs (Live Activity Diagrams) by liveness-enriched constructs inspired by LSCs (Live Sequence Charts) for stating precise execution modalities. We aim at a tool-supported execution of LAD specifications allowing for early simulation and validation of requirements. We present an implementation of an LAD execution engine and describe the there upon suggested requirements engineering approach by means of an automotive case study.","","978-0-7695-3302-5","","10.1109/SERA.2008.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609410","Activity Diagrams;Live Sequence Charts;Model Driven Engineering;Requirements Engineering;Unified Modeling Language","Application software;Automotive engineering;Conference management;Design engineering;Engineering management;Engines;Software engineering;Software systems;Systems engineering and theory;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;formal specification;program verification","LADs;LSCs;UML 2;live activity diagrams;live sequence charts;requirements engineering;requirements specification;seamless model-based methodology;software systems engineering","","","","0","","21","","","20080829","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these systems, safety is of paramount importance. Safety is broadly defined as freedom from accidents and loss. When no safe alternative to normal service exists, a system must be dependable to be safe, that is, it must have reliable ways to deliver a certain quality of service. Our collaborations with industrial partners have focused on HIRTS modeling techniques. Initially, we explored the potential benefits that the most successful software architecture and modeling approaches could bring to the safety-critical domain. We subsequently designed the architecture information modeling language. AIM lets us exploit the available technologies from the same platform and thus provide stronger support for the safety case. A safety case, a key element in HIRTS certification, typically consists of a high-level argument and supporting evidence. The HLA sets the principles on which the design is based and reasons why the design should satisfy the safety requirements.","0740-7459","","","10.1109/MS.2006.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605181","architecture description languages;model development;modeling methodologies;safety-critical systems;software architecture","Aerospace electronics;Aerospace industry;Architecture description languages;Automotive engineering;Computer industry;Embedded software;Industrial accidents;Quality of service;Real time systems;Safety","Unified Modeling Language;data integrity;embedded systems;safety-critical software;security of data;software architecture","architecture description language;architecture information modeling language;high-integrity real-time system;safety-critical system;software architecture","","","","1","","8","","","20060313","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes the requirements of a tool set that will effectively meet these demands. Software tools that allow graphical specification of control systems and models should permit users to create and simulate target independently and hence reusable plant models and control functions. At the same time, this simulation environment should be compatible with rapid prototyping hardware, as well as support implementation-specific requirements. Support for operating system specific functions is also an essential element for an integrated ECU development platform. Finally, the ECU development tool set must support automatic production code generation. A common development platform creates an environment in which the various engineers can communicate efficiently in a common language where transfer of information and code is uninhibited by the inherent problems of disparate software toots","","0-7803-5500-8","","10.1109/CACSD.1999.808651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=808651","","Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Hardware;Operating systems;Software prototyping;Software tools;Time to market;Virtual prototyping","automobiles;automotive electronics;computerised control;control system CAD;embedded systems;operating systems (computers);software prototyping;software tools","automobiles;automotive electronics;electronic control unit;embedded control system;operating system;rapid prototyping;software tools","","","","2","2","17","","","20020806","22 Aug 1999-27 Aug 1999","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a methodology, called Abstract Testing, in which test cases are replaced by verification scenarios. Such verification scenarios are more abstract than test cases, thus fewer of them are needed and they are easier to create and maintain. Checking verification scenarios against the source code is done automatically using a software model checker. In this paper we describe the general idea of Abstract Testing, and demonstrate its feasibility by a case study from the automotive systems domain.","","978-1-4244-8539-0","978-0-7695-4241-6","10.1109/QUATIC.2010.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654792","abstract testing verification requirements engineering bounded model checking","Automotive engineering;Biological system modeling;Control systems;Driver circuits;Safety;Software;Testing","program testing;program verification","abstract testing;automotive systems domain;software model checker;source code verification;test case;verification checking","","","","0","","33","","","20101203","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides a desirable simulation framework for system architecture design and exploration. This paper presents a design framework, called SysCOLA, that makes use of the unique advantages of both a new formal modeling language, COLA, and SystemC, and allows for parallel development of application software and system platform. In SysCOLA, function design and architecture exploration are done in the COLA based modeling environment and the SystemC based virtual prototyping environment, respectively. Our concepts of abstract platform and virtual platform abstraction layer facilitate the orthogonalization of functionality and architecture by means of mapping and integration in the respective environments.

It has recently been shown that PWL function evaluation can be accelerated by searching a binary tree data structure, leading to highly efficient, accurate, and verifiable software implementation in low-cost embedded control units. In this work, we report hardware synthesis results for this type of PWL control, and show that explicit MPC solutions can be implemented in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with about 20 000 gates, leading to computation times in the microsecond scale. This opens the way for the use of highly advanced control designs such as constrained MPC in small-scale industrial and consumer electronics application areas that are characterized by fast sampling or low cost, including mechatronics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), automotive control, power electronics, and acoustics.

Therefore special tools for developing and testing such integrated and networked automotive safety systems have to be devised.

It also includes a fail-safe tester to be able to test the physical errors.

This paper describes an approach towards semi-automation of some steps of individual review processes based on checklists. The method proposed is interactive, i.e. reviewers will be enabled to actualize, extend, and check the consistency and redundancy of their checklists. The basic idea underlying the approach is the usage of a rule-based system, adapting concepts of the compiler theory and knowledge engineering, for acquisition and representation of knowledge about the program. Redundant and conflicting knowledge about the program under study is recognized and solved by means of an embedded truth maintenance system. As a result of fault diagnosis, rules for fault classification are used. Software reliability models are applied to validate the results of each review session.

This ability is becoming ever more crucial within embedded systems development, as a critical activity of testing, verification, validation and certification. However, semi-automatically or fully-automatically generating accurate trace links remains an open research challenge, especially for legacy systems. Vector Space Model (VSM), a notably known Information Retrieval (IR) technique aims to remedy this situation. However, VSM's low-accuracy level in practice is a limitation. The contribution of this paper is an improved VSM-based post-requirements trace ability recovery approach using a novel context analysis. Specifically, the analysis method can better utilize context information extracted from use cases to discover relevant source code files. Our approach is evaluated by using three different embedded applications in the domains of industrial automation, automotive and mobile. The evaluation shows that our new approach can achieve better accuracy than VSM, in terms of higher values of three main IR metrics, i.e., recall, precision, and mean average precision, when it handles embedded software applications.","","","","10.1109/SEAA.2013.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6619519","context analysis;embedded system;functional requirements;post-requirements traceability;trace link recovery;vector space model (VSM)","Accuracy;Context;Context modeling;Ice;Software;Standards;Vectors","embedded systems;information retrieval;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;software metrics;source coding","IR metrics;VSM-based post-requirements traceability recovery approach;automotive domains;context analysis;context information extraction;context-based information retrieval technique;design documents;embedded software applications;embedded software system development;industrial automation;legacy systems;mean average precision;mobile domains;source code;source code file discovery;test cases;use-case-to-source-code trace link recovery;vector space model","","","","0","","","","","20131010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The torque-speed characteristics of a real scroll compressor have been measured and then emulated by a brushless internal mounted permanent magnets machine controlled in torque. This emulated scroll compressor has been driven by a field-oriented controlled induction motor drive. The whole car model as well as the PEMFC have been implemented by software on the same DSP which implements the drive control algorithm; in this way, the hardware-in-the-loop structure has been employed for emulating the behavior of a real car including the electrical supply of the PEMFC. The whole system has been tested with a classic European Driving Cycle. Two experimental rigs have been setup, one for characterizing the scroll compressor and the other for emulating the entire vehicle. The experimental results have shown that the speed reference profile, obtained during a urban driving cycle, is followed correctly, and that the tank-to-wheel efficiency remains at quite high values confirming the goodness of the proposed technological solution. The hardware-in-the-loop approach of the experimental rig allows tests to be performed to verify the operation in steady and transient states with low cost and reduced employment of the fuel cell stack, with resulting increased durability.","0093-9994","","","10.1109/TIA.2008.2006304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681957","Automotive applications;compressors for fuel cells;fuel cell air management;high-performance motor drives","Automotive applications;Biomembranes;Fuel cells;Induction machines;Induction motor drives;Magnetic field measurement;Permanent magnet machines;Protons;Technology management;Torque measurement","automotive engineering;brushless machines;compressors;induction motor drives;permanent magnet machines;proton exchange membrane fuel cells;torque control","European Driving Cycle;PEMFC system;air management;automotive;brushless internal mounted permanent magnets machine;drive control algorithm;durability;hardware-in-the-loop structure;induction motor drive;proton exchange membrane fuel cells;scroll compressor;speed reference profile;tank-to-wheel efficiency;torque-speed characteristics","","","","6","","22","","","20081118","","IEEE","IEEE Industry Applications Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This study details an investigation into the design modification of a brake pad for the front disc brake system as found on a typical passenger vehicle, and reports how the design modification can be improved to reduce the occurrence of squeal. As an extension to earlier finite element (FE) brake models described in literature, a detailed FE model of the whole disc brake corner is developed and validated using experimental modal analysis. Stability analysis of the disc brake corner using the FE software ABAQUS is carried out to predict squeal occurrence. To reduce squeal noise, stability analysis was conducted for several geometrical modifications on the pad. The results show that squeal could be reduced if the back plate and friction material thickness are increased.","","978-1-4244-9081-3","","10.1109/FAME.2010.5714864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714864","","Analytical models;Finite element methods;Friction;Materials;Noise;Predictive models;Rotors","brakes;design engineering;discs (structures);finite element analysis;friction;mechanical stability;modal analysis;noise abatement;plates (structures);road vehicles","FE software ABAQUS;automotive brake squeal;automotive industry;design modification;experimental modal analysis;finite element brake models;friction material thickness;front disc brake corner;noise reduction;pad geometrical modification;passenger vehicle;plate;ride comfort;squeal occurrence prediction;stability analysis","","","","0","","9","","","20110217","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A very good example of cyber-physical systems design arises in the context of automotive architectures and software. Modern high-end cars have 50-100 processors or electronic control units (ECUs) that communicate over a network of buses such as CAN and FlexRay. In such complex settings, traditional control-theoretic approaches - where control engineers are only concerned with high-level plant and controller models - start breaking down. Instead it becomes necessary to adopt a more holistic, cyber-physical systems design approach where the semantic gap between high-level control models and their actual implementations on multiprocessor platforms is quantified and consciously closed.

After the product integration design is finalized, the Production Tool Design and Build (PTDB) processes becomes the VDP critical path. It is in the PTDB where virtual launch and validation activities are performed. To increase throughput of the engineering factory and reduce product development cost, we propose a research initiative in the area of Virtual Launch & Validation (VLV) of Manufacturing Automation Controls (MAC). VLV of MAC is composed of a series of PTDB launch and pre-launch activities in a virtual environment using physical, emulated, and simulated hardware and software. It encompasses the testing of MAC, its interactions with MAC analysis tools, and its interfaces with IT systems and related business processes. VLV of MAC also supports the development and testing of new IT systems and business processes as well as its hardware and software plant floor systems constituents. The mission of VLV of MAC is to minimize the duration of the launch and ramp up activities by reducing the implementation and execution times for plant floor systems and equipments via a priori system emulation, validation and testing. Based on our findings, we conclude that the most pressing needs for VLV of MAC lie in the thrust areas of object-oriented standard logic, auto-generation of virtual models, logic validation and system wide emulation. In summary, we conservatively estimate that a successful VLV of MAC implementation will reduce the VDP duration by several weeks hence providing automakers with savings in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per year.","","978-1-4244-5447-1","","10.1109/COASE.2010.5583977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5583977","","Computational modeling;Data models;Object oriented modeling;Production;Software;Solid modeling;Vehicles","automobile industry;factory automation;machine tools;product design;product development;virtual reality","IT system;MAC analysis tool;PTDB process;VDP critical path;automotive industry;business process;engineering factory;logic validation;manufacturing automation control;manufacturing engineering activity;object-oriented standard logic;plant floor system;product development cost;product integration design;production tool design and build;vehicle development process;virtual environment;virtual launch and validation;virtual model","","","","0","","45","","","20101021","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to different driving conditions and body posture, semi-active suspension based on MR damper can coordinate the body posture angle, and reduce the vibration from suspension pass to vehicle body. This paper deals with theoretical analysis and experiments of MR fluid damper in semi-active suspension system.

The paper presents a simple circuit-oriented method to simulate a six-phase squirrel-cage induction machine (6PIM) in order to predict its performances. This method can be applied for different types of induction machines (one-phase, three-phase, six-phase and n-phase induction machines) and it consists in the elaboration of an electric equivalent circuit obtained from minimal dimensional knowledge of stator and rotor parts of the machine under study. It takes into account only the magnetic circuit dimensions and the airgap length. A six-phase squirrel-cage induction machine of 0.09 kW, 17 V, 50 Hz, 2-poles is used for the experimental set-up. The magnetic structure available by a standard three phase induction machine has been redesigned for getting the six phase one using a software devoted to the electromagnetic design and analysis of three phase induction machines. The finite element method associated to an induction machine non linear model has been used too with a complete description of stator and rotor cores using the iron non-linear characteristic for the final verification. The simulation results given by the circuit-oriented and the non linear modeling methods are compared with the experimental results for the classical torque-speed, current-speed and torque-current characteristics","1553-572X","1-4244-0390-1","","10.1109/IECON.2006.347469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4152966","Circuit-oriented model;Finite element method;Non linear modeling;Six-phase induction machine","Automotive applications;Circuit simulation;Equivalent circuits;Induction machines;Induction motors;Machine windings;Power steering;Predictive models;Stator cores;Wire","asynchronous machines;automotive engineering;equivalent circuits;finite element analysis;magnetic circuits;rotors;stators;steering systems","0.09 kW;17 V;42 V;50 Hz;automotive applications;circuit-oriented model;displacement windings;electric equivalent circuit;electrical power steering;electromagnetic design;finite element method;magnetic circuit;magnetic structure;rotor;six-phase induction machine;stator;steering by wire;three phase machine;three phase windings","","","","1","","10","","","20070416","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Power dissipation is calculated from the duty cycle, δ, load current, I<sub>M</sub>, and the junction temperature T. The results, which are the power dissipation values for all combinations of (δ,I<sub>M</sub>,T), are used to fill in a look-up table. Then the HDTMOS structure (chip, packaging and heatsink) is described with the help of the REBECA-3D software package, and the electrothermal balance is found for given waveforms of current and duty cycle.

The torque-speed characteristics of a real scroll compressor have been measured and then emulated by a brushless IMPM (internal mounted permanent magnets) machine controlled in torque. This emulated scroll compressor has been driven by a field oriented controlled (FOC) induction motor drive. The whole car model as well as the PEMFC have been implemented by software on the same DSP which implements the drive control algorithm; in this way the hardware-in-the-loop structure has been employed for emulating the behaviour of a real car including the electrical supply of the PEMFC. The whole system has been tested with a classic European driving cycle. Two experimental rigs have been setup, one for characterizing the scroll compressor and the other for emulating the entire vehicle. The experimental results have shown that the speed reference profile, obtained during a urban driving cycle, is followed correctly and that the tank-to-wheel efficiency remains at quite high values confirming the goodness of the proposed technological solution. The hardware-in-the-loop approach of the experimental rig allows tests to be performed to verify the operation in steady and transient states with low cost and reduced employment of the Fuel Cell stack, with resulting increased durability.","0197-2618","978-1-4244-1259-4","","10.1109/07IAS.2007.150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4347899","","Automotive applications;Biomembranes;Fuel cells;Induction machines;Induction motor drives;Magnetic field measurement;Permanent magnets;Protons;Technology management;Torque measurement","fuel cell vehicles;induction motor drives;proton exchange membrane fuel cells","IMPM;PEMFC system;air management;fuel cell vehicles;induction motor drive;internal mounted permanent magnets;proton exchange membrane fuel cells;scroll compressor;torque speed characteristics","","","","0","","","","","20071015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The development of efficient and cost-effective electronic control units that meet the necessary real-time performance for these systems is a complex challenge. Often, Electronic System-Level design tackles the challenge by simulation-based performance evaluation, although, the quality of system-level performance simulation approaches is not yet evaluated in detail. In this paper, we present the calibration and validation of a system-level performance simulation model. For evaluation, an automotive pedestrian detection algorithm is studied. Especially the varying number of pedestrians has a significant impact to the system performance and makes the prediction of execution time difficult. As test cases we used typical sequences and corner cases recorded by an experimental car. Our evaluation results indicate that prediction of execution times with an average error of 3.1% and a maximum error of 7.9% can be achieved. Thereby, simulated and measured execution times of a software implementation are compared.","","978-1-4577-0802-2","978-1-4577-0801-5","10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045460","","Accuracy;Calibration;Computational modeling;Dynamic scheduling;Estimation;Processor scheduling;Software","calibration;driver information systems;object detection;software performance evaluation","automotive pedestrian detection algorithm;calibration;driver assistance systems;electronic system-level design;lane departure warning;road vehicles;simulation-based performance evaluation;software implementation;software performance models;traffic sign recognition;validation","","","","1","","19","","","20111017","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to this increasing complexity there is an indispensable need for virtual prototypes. However, the creation of such TIER-1 designs bares some challenges, for example simulation performance, modelling effort, and the assembly of models from different vendors. This paper discusses various ways for creating models for a system simulation at TIER-1 level, such as the anti-lock braking system.

Especially the fact that software often is embedded either in a system or in a process and, therefore, is strongly influenced by its environment enforces the demand for a combined representation. We propose a concept for a multi-modeling approach based on existing technology. Multi-modeling means the combination of the two main modeling paradigms to represent a heterogeneous domain. The major benefit of the approach is the reduction of representation complexity by optimizing the representation of single subdomains. This will be shown on one representative case study from the automotive domain. Another advantage is the improved stakeholder communication because of familiar notations.

For safety reasons, particular emphasis is placed on robust system design in the automotive and aerospace sectors. Until now, the term robustness has been applied very intuitively and there has been no proper way to actually measure robustness. However, the complexity of contemporary systems makes it difficult to fulfill tight specifications. For this reason, robustness must be integrated into a partially automated design flow. In this paper, a new approach to robustness modeling is presented, in addition to new ways to quantify or assess the robustness of a design. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach, it is adapted and applied to several different scenarios. These include the robustness evaluation of digital circuits under aging effects, such as NBTI; the robustness modeling of analog and mixed signal circuits using affine arithmetic; and the robustness study of software algorithms on a high system level.","","978-1-4673-2687-2","","10.1109/ACQED.2012.6320491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6320491","NBTI;Robustness;affine arithmetic;aging;analog;digital;softerrors;system","Human computer interaction;Robustness;Testing","ageing;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit measurement","NBTI;aerospace sector;affine arithmetic;aging effect;analog circuit;automotive sector;contemporary complexity system;digital circuit;integrated circuit design;mixed signal circuit;parasitic element effect;partially automated design flow;robust system design","","","","0","","16","","","20121004","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to further miniaturization, NEMS sensor find important application in biomedical field for invasive pressure measurements like intra-cranial pressure, arterial blood pressure monitoring, central venous pressure monitoring etc. In present work also a low pressure square diaphragm piezoresistive NEMS sensor of diaphragm length 1500 nm and thickness 100 nm (aspect ratio (h/L=0.07)) respectively has been designed using the analytical models for NEMS pressure sensors. The designed sensor has been characterized through FEM simulation using MEMS CAD software tools and the analytical and simulation results have been found to be in good agreement. Also, the finite element method simulation has been used to calculate maximum stress location which is useful for placement of piezoresistive sensing element at high stress region necessary to get maximum output. The analytical and simulation results show that the designed sensor has full scale output (FSO) of 0.16mV/V and is linear in its operating range of 5kPa pressure.

To estimate product reliability, reliability engineers require an understanding of product stress. Such estimates are more meaningful if stress relates directly to product use. Because often usage data is stable and varies little over time, obtaining representative mathematical models for stress and usage is feasible. Applying discrete event simulation along with usage and stress distributions can then simplify traditional modeling approaches (which required second-by-second data sets for every use element), thus reducing cost and time to acquire information. Developing modules that replicate conditions based on factors such as geographic location, time, etc. gives companies more flexibility in usage models to better support new global markets and product applications.

"Automating the failure modes and effects analysis of safety critical systems","Papadopoulos, Y.; Parker, D.; Gran, C.","Dept. of Comput.

Eighth IEEE International Symposium on","25-26 March 2004","2004","","","310","311","Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a classical system safety analysis technique which is currently widely used in the automotive, aerospace and other safety critical industries. In the process of an FMEA, analysts compile lists of component failure modes and try to infer the effects of those failure modes on the system. System models, typically simple engineering diagrams, assist analysts in understanding how the local effects of component failures propagate through complex architectures and ultimately cause hazardous effects at system level. Although there is software available that assists engineers in performing clerical tasks, such as forming tables and filling in data, the intelligent part of an FMEA process remains a manual and laborious process. Thus, one of the main criticisms of FMEA is that the time taken to perform the analysis can often exceed the period of the design and development phases and therefore the analysis de facto becomes a mere deliverable to the customer and not a useful tool capable of improving the design. Difficulties naturally become more acute as systems grow in scale and complexity. To address those difficulties, a body of work is looking into the automation and simplification of FMEA (Renovell et al., 1985). To mechanically infer the effects of component failures in a system, several approaches have been proposed which use domain specific qualitative or quantitative fault simulation. These approaches are restricted to particular application domains such as the design of electrical or electronic circuits. Limitations in scope but also difficulties with the efficiency and scalability of algorithms seem to have so far limited the industrial take-up of this automated FMEA technology which is still under development. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the automatic synthesis of FMEAs which builds upon recent work towards automating fault tree analysis (Papadopoulos et al., 2001). In this approach, FMEAs are built from engineering diagrams that have been augmented with information about component failures. The proposed approach is generic, i.e. not restricted to an application domain, and potentially applicable to a range of widely used engineering models. The models that provide the basis for the analysis identif- y the topology of the system, i.e. the system components and the material energy and data transactions among those components. Models can also be hierarchically structured and record in different layers the decomposition of subsystems into more basic components. We should note that this type of structural models include piping and instrumentation diagrams, data flow diagrams and other models commonly used in many areas of engineering design.","1530-2059","0-7695-2094-4","","10.1109/HASE.2004.1281774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281774","","Aerospace engineering;Aerospace industry;Aerospace safety;Automotive engineering;Cause effect analysis;Computer architecture;Data engineering;Failure analysis;Performance analysis;Software performance","data flow analysis;fault trees;safety-critical software;software architecture;software fault tolerance","FMEA;component failure modes;data flow;data transactions;failure effect analysis;failure mode analysis;fault simulation;fault tree analysis;safety critical systems;software design;software development;system models;system safety analysis;system topology","","","","7","3","5","","","20040824","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is based on the main EME-relevant parameters of digital circuits, i.e. dynamic power and clock rates. This information should be even available before the IC design phase starts. With this approach, the models can be created without any additional information about module size, functional patterns or embedded decoupling capacitors. Thus it can be used to perform design studies wrt. clock rate selection, clock modulation and impact of dynamic power consumption. The modelling and simulation software can even handle very complex ICs like high-end 32-bit microcontrollers. The program is named EMISoC which stands for “EMI simulation of systems-on-chip”. It has been validated for existing 65 nm CMOS designs and is currently used for emission estimations of future 40 nm microcontrollers for automotive applications.

The expanding reach and pervasiveness of personal and embedded computing are accompanied by proportional increases in concerns about information security. Embedded computing systems are being used in critical applications (medical electronics, automotive systems, and avionics, manufacturing control, smart grid), where the consequence of security attacks can be severe. Furthermore, several business models (e.g., e-commerce, distribution of multimedia content, etc.) require an adequate level of security in the associated electronic systems in order to be viable. On the other hand, the increasing complexity and networked nature of embedded systems have led to more vulnerabilities that can be more easily targeted for security attacks. If our past experience is any indication, conventional approaches to security or simple add-on security schemes are insufficient. Adequate security can be achieved in a system only if security is considered throughout the design process, including the design of the system-on-chips (SoCs) (hardware and embedded software). It is therefore imperative that SoC architects, HW designers, and embedded SW developers be aware of the security challenges and techniques to address them. This tutorial will introduce security challenges in embedded systems, identify the security requirements for SoCs that they contain, and present approaches to designing secure SoCs. Secure SoC design will be described as an attempt to bridge three ""design gaps"" - the assurance gap, performance gap, and battery gap. Examples from various state-of-the-art commercial SoCs will be used to illustrate the presented concepts. The tutorial is organized into five parts. Part 1 will focus on security concerns and challenges in secure SoC design. Part 2 will describe HW architectures for efficient security processing. Parts 3 and 4 will delve into the realm of SW and HW/side-channel attacks, and design countermeasures against them.

Virtual CAN networks on top of a time-triggered communication protocol are a solution to integrate existing CAN-based legacy applications into such a time-triggered architecture. Thus, there is the possibility to eliminate physical CAN networks, which leads to cost reductions and reliability improvements. In order to ensure that existing CAN-based software works correctly in a time-triggered architecture, a virtual CAN network must provide the temporal behavior of a physical CAN network. For this reason, we develop a solution for establishing in a virtual CAN network the same temporal message order as in a physical CAN network.

FPDS is one of Ford's major world-wide initiatives, that aims to strengthen the Corporation's position in the competitive automotive market place. The main themes of FPDS are a dramatic shortening of time-to-market, a reduction in development costs, and greater customer perception of product quality and value. One of the key mechanisms for achieving these goals is the aggressive use of modelling, simulation and analysis, in order to facilitate greater iteration and exploration of the properties of a design before committing it to hardware and production. At the same time as the process by which a modern car is designed is changing, so is the degree of complexity of the product itself. This is especially true in the application of embedded electronics and software, to control more of the vehicle's functions, and to offer the customer more convenience and comfort features. Examples include, engine management, brake controls, air conditioning, and body functions such as wipers, lights and locking. Not only is the number of applications of electronic control increasing, but so is the interdependence between these systems; for example traction and stability control are essentially achieved by combining engine control and brake control.

Statistical Process Control (SPC) metrics define an “in-control” region where the statistical assumptions apply, and an outlier region where they do not apply. The gauge is monitored on-line to verify that production corresponds to the area of the operation where the gauge algorithms are known to work.

Through computer vision, and taking into account the different elements that can be utilized in an industrial environment, we propose the use of a component based architecture for easily designing and building industrial inspection systems for this kind of parts. Within this architecture, each software, or hardware element, is encapsulated in a component with a predefined input/ouput layout and, later, it can be used considering the task inspection requirements. The main advantages of the proposed working philosophy are its flexibility, that the resulting machine vision can be easily adapted to any kind of headlamp lens, and that it is fully open to any new component (lighting system, process algorithm, industrial conveyor, etc.). This proposition has been successfully validated building an industrial prototype that was tested in both, the lab, and in a production line.","2161-8070","978-1-4577-1730-7","978-1-4577-1731-4","10.1109/CASE.2011.6042455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042455","","Cameras;Hardware;Inspection;Lenses;Lighting;Machine vision;Software","automobile industry;automotive components;computer vision;inspection;lenses;mechanical engineering computing;production engineering computing","adaptable vision system;automotive headlamp lenses;component based architecture;component-based methodology;computer vision;flexible inspection systems;industrial conveyor;industrial inspection systems;lighting system;machine vision;process algorithm;surface defect automatic inspection;task inspection requirements","","","","0","","13","","","20111013","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different teams may have to use different requirements modeling formalisms to express requirements related to their assigned parts of a given project. This situation poses difficulties in achieving interoperability and integration of requirements models for the purpose of reasoning on the overall system requirements. It is challenging to compose distributed models expressed in different notations and to reason on the composed models. In this paper we present a metamodeling approach which allows reasoning about requirements and their relations on the whole/composed models expressed in different requirements modeling approaches. In a previous work we expressed the structure of requirements documents as a requirements metamodel in which the most important elements are requirements relations and their types. The semantics of these elements is given in First Order Logic (FOL) and allows two activities: inferring new relations from the initial set of relations and checking consistency of relations. In this work we use the requirements metamodel as a core metamodel to be specialized for different requirements modeling approaches and notations such as Product-line and SysML. Mainly, the requirements relations in the metamodel are specialized to support relations in different requirements modeling approaches. The specialization allows using the same semantics and reasoning mechanism of the core metamodel for multiple requirements modeling approaches. To illustrate the approach we use an example from automotive domain expressed with two modeling approaches: product-line requirements models and SysML for system requirements.","1541-7719","","","10.1109/EDOC.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658275","SysML;model-driven engineering;product-line requirements;requirements metamodel;requirements reasoning","Automotive engineering;Cognition;Engines;Gears;OWL;Semantics;Unified modeling language","formal specification;formal verification;open systems;product development;project management;reasoning about programs;software development management;software prototyping;systems analysis","FOL;SysML;complex software development projects;composed models;distributed models;first order logic;interoperability;metamodeling approach;multiple requirements engineering approaches;multiple requirements modelling formalism;product-line requirements models;reasoning about requirements;reasoning mechanism;requirement documents;requirements model integration;requirements modeling approach;system requirements","","","","0","","","","","20131114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, the enormous complexity of systems today requires a much more structured approach to engineering anyhow. It will be demonstrated how to derive a better structuring of systems by three complementary views at the conceptual level including 1) the context view in terms of context models, 2) the functional view by function hierarchies and operational modes 3) component architecture models. These views bridge the gap between functional requirements and their technical realization. We show how such an approach leads to a more structured understanding of systems in terms of different views on their properties and their mutual logical relation and how this can be used as a basis for product line engineering. We introduce concepts, in particular, of logic to define logical dependencies between different levels of abstractions and perspectives of systems.","","978-1-4577-1029-2","","10.1109/SPLC.2011.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030039","","Actuators;Component architectures;Computer architecture;Context;Modeling;Sensors;Software","formal specification;production engineering computing","automotive system;component architecture model;context model;function hierarchy;individual system;logical dependency;mutual logical relation;operational mode;product line engineering;specification","","","","0","","","","","20110929","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such developments need to be employed rapidly, reducing the time involved in deploying controllers for new applications. Furthermore, the insertion of advanced control on a large scale cannot require significant numbers of highly skilled (e.g., Ph.D.-degreed) staff.<br> Thus control technology must be packaged in a form that allows small teams of control engineers to efficiently exploit new research developments and to minimize the cycle time from specification to product. It is a sign of the maturity of control that this packaging is now being accomplished through the development of computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tools. In industries where customized control applications are a frequent demand, CACSD tools that automate several of the steps involved in the practice of control design are now regularly used. At the same time, research continues toward the goal of end-to-end (specification to deployment-ready software) control design automation. No practicing control engineer today can afford to be ignorant of CACSD; it must be considered as much a part of one's professional education as, say, the first course in nonlinear control.<br> This chapter provides an introduction to CACSD, with specific emphasis on control design automation. System modeling, performance specifications by way of mathematical criteria, and iterative algorithms for realizing an ultimately satisfactory controller are among the topics covered. In other chapters in this volume, the state of the art and current research trends in CACSD are discussed in depth from the perspective of two control application domainsï¿¿-ï¿¿automotive powertrain control (Chapter 12) and flight control (Chapter 13).

The present work proposes a conceptual approach for the holistic product lifecycle assessment (LCA) of an electric drive for the automotive industry. The proceeding is part of the NRW Bank funded Project KERME (engl.: Competitive Electro-Mobility through Resource Efficiently and Modularly Designed E-Drives). KERME aims at the eco-efficient production of a scalable E-Drive, which finally enables the manufacturers to realize economies of scale, which in return is a key condition for a successful adaption of environmentally friendly transportation concepts by the end users due to reduced sale prices. The investigated electric drive will be designed to meet the load spectrum of a compact vehicle for close-by traffic in an urban environment. Accordingly, the engine is supposed to provide short but intensive phases of acceleration followed by long downtimes. Suitable engine concepts are the synchronous and asynchronous layout with an internal rotor and liquid cooling (P = 30 kW, n<sub>max</sub> = 9000-12000 rpm, V = 300-400 V, dimensions (length × external diameter of box): 480 × 270 mm). Following the guidelines in ISO 14040/44, the analysis will determine the ecological impact of an E-Drive during all of the following lifecycle stages: Production of raw materials, manufacturing phase (including final assembly) and utilization phase. However, the focus of the analysis will be the manufacturing processes, completed by assumptions and mathematical models about the remaining phases. The analysis will break down the absorbed flows of resources and energy to the applied manufacturing processes per manufactured E-Drive. By doing so, the contribution of each production step to the over-all energy consumption, global warming potential - r any other factor of ecological impact (e.g. eutrophication, eco- and human-toxicity) can be determined. Accordingly, those processes can be identified, which are the most promising to be modified in order to improve the energy efficiency of the production system and thus to lower the manufacturing costs while protecting the environment at the same time. In detail, the proposed work investigates the manufacturing and assembly of the main engine parts lamination stack, housing, rotor, stator and shaft. Thus, the E-Drive production includes a great variety of manufacturing technologies mentioned in DIN 8580: Primary forming (e.g. casting of housing), forming (e.g. stamping of magnetic strips in lamination stack), cutting (e.g. machining of shaft), joining (e.g. adhesive joint of box and stator), coating (electrical insulation of stator-grooves), modifying material properties (e.g. heat treatment of shaft). Physical measurement techniques will later be applied in order to determine the absorbed flows of electrical power, cutting fluids and material of each machine tool. By implementing and validating the production chain into a software tool (GaBi 5) possible scenarios with alternative manufacturing processes or materials can be analyzed concerning their impact on the ecological impact of the engine without conducting costly and time-consuming experiments.","","978-1-4673-3007-7","","10.1109/EDPC.2012.6425130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425130","Automotive Industry;Ecological Footprint;Ecological Lifecycle Assessment","Electricity;Engines;Raw materials;Shafts","automobiles;coatings;cutting;design for environment;electric drives;electric vehicles;forming processes;product life cycle management;rotors;shafts;stators","GaBi 5 software tool;ISO 14040/44;asynchronous layout;automotive industry;coating;competitive electro-mobility;cutting;eco-efficient production;ecological lifecycle assessment;efficiently designed e-drives;electric drive;electrical insulation;electrical machines;forming process;global warming;holistic product lifecycle assessment;housing;main engine parts lamination stack;manufacturing processes;modularly designed e-drives;power 30 kW;rotor;shaft;size 270 mm;size 480 mm;stator;voltage 300 V to 400 V","","","","0","","18","","","20130131","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In early design phases, even when there is still uncertainty about the feasibility of the requirements, valuable information can be gained from models that describe the expected usage and the desired system reaction. The generation of test cases from these models indicates the feasibility of the intended solution and helps to identify scenarios for which the realization is hardly feasible or the intended system behavior is not properly defined. In this paper we present the formalization of requirements by models to simulate the expected field usage of a system. These so called usage models can be enriched by information about the desired system reaction. Thus, they are the basis for all subsequent testing activities: First, they can be used to verify the first implementation models and design decisions w.r.t. the fulfillment of requirements and second, test cases can be derived in a random or statistic manner. The generation can be controlled with operational profiles that describe different classes of field usage. We have applied our approach at a large German car manufacturer in the early development phase of active safety functionalities. Test cases were generated from the usage models to assess the implementation models in MATLAB/Simulink. The parametrization of the systems could be optimized and a faulty transition in the implementation models was revealed.

In this paper, we analyze structural models of a modern realistic automotive vehicle system with the aim to assess the extent and characteristics of interactions between system functions. Our results show that at least 69% of the analyzed system functions depend on each other or influence each other.

The increase in usage of electronic engine control can be attributed mainly to the increasing pressure on vehicle manufacturers to reduce the tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (GO) and nitric oxides (NOx). A degree of control over exhaust emissions can be achieved through the use of advanced electronic hardware/software, as part of an integrated engine management system (EMS), and such an approach offers greater flexibility and closer control than traditional mechanical devices. The paper describes the application of modelling and simulation methods to aid engine management calibration and, in particular, calibration of on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems. Two case studies are presented. The first is focussed on the calibration of an airflow meter and manifold pressure sensor of a 4.0 litre V8 engine. The second describes some aspects of a hardware in the loop (HIL) facility, and its use to perform a number of EMS diagnostic checks as defined by legislation. The objective is to make use of a HIL system to verify that EMS diagnostic software meets specified requirements. In both case studies, modelling tools have allowed accurate diagnostic checks to be developed and tested","","","","10.1049/ic:20000230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848163","","","internal combustion engines","EMS diagnostic software;OBD systems;accurate diagnostic checks;airflow meter;automotive engine control;electronic engine control;electronic hardware;electronic hardware/software;engine management calibration;engine management on board diagnostic system calibration;exhaust emission control;hardware in the loop;integrated engine management system;manifold pressure sensor;modelling tools;simulation methods;simulation tools;tailpipe emissions;vehicle manufacturers","","","","0","","","","","20020806","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

Saarland University and AbsInt GmbH have successfully developed the aiT WCET analyzer for computing safe upper bounds on the WCET of a task. The computation is mainly based on abstract interpretation of timing models of the processor and its periphery. Such timing models are currently hand-crafted by human experts.

We introduce the notion of reliability deficiency to represent the difference between the specified and the actual value of the reliability achieved by a schedule and present techniques to make up the reliability deficiency. The presented approach is primarily applicable to specify the reliability requirements of context-sensitive tasks executed by a real-time software system so that they can overcome transient failures using temporal redundancy, i.e., repetitive execution of the same task.

In this paper we introduce such a maintenance-oriented fault model that establishes the conceptual foundation of the diagnostic services of the DECOS integrated architecture.

It is specifically designed to reproduce geometric shapes with functional requirements such as aerodynamic and hydrodynamic profiles. This primitive can be useful when a known and well defined map between functional requirements and geometric data does not exist, and it have to be deduced by a physical or numerical experimental analysis. BNN gives rise to a typical CAD representation, a Bezier curve, of a functional profile, once the functional parameters are supplied. In BNN the capability of neural network to approximate very complex and non-linear function has been combined with the capability of Bezier functions to describe geometry, in a unique neural network.

This paper selects the soft prolate spheroid as the baffle model. The prolate spheroid baffle is meshed by finite element software, then the mesh is imported into the boundary element software and the directivity of pressure and vibration velocity of diffraction acoustic field are calculated at different frequencies. The results show that under the condition of soft baffle, the pressure is zero on the boundary of the baffle, the phase of diffraction wave and incident wave is reversed and the amplitude of the diffraction wave is equal to the amplitude of incident wave. The symmetry of the directivity of pressure is better in low frequency, but because of the reversed-phase superposition of the diffraction wave and the incident wave, the amplitude of pressure is relatively small. As the frequency increasing, the directivity of pressure is seriously distorted. Because the acoustic energy of diffraction wave mainly concentrates in the radial direction, the radial velocity is seriously distorted by the diffraction wave, on the contrary, horizontal velocity is less distorted.","","978-1-4244-5701-4","","10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5512415","boundary element method (BEM);prolate spheroid;vector sensor","Acoustic diffraction;Acoustic distortion;Acoustic measurements;Acoustic sensors;Acoustical engineering;Automotive engineering;Boundary element methods;Finite element methods;Frequency;Underwater acoustics","finite element analysis;sensors;sonar;underwater vehicles","acoustic energy;acoustic vector sensor directivity;boundary element software;diffraction acoustic field;diffraction wave amplitude;finite element software;horizontal velocity;incident wave amplitude;pressure amplitude;pressure directivity;radial velocity;reversed-phase superposition;soft prolate spheroid baffle model;sonar dome;underwater vehicles;vibration velocity","","","","0","","16","","","20100719","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A HWIL simulator consists of a subset of hardware from a real object interfaced to a control system, with the goal of matching the closed loop behaviour of the simulator to that of the complete object. The simulator design problem is qualitatively different from the standard control design problem; while classical control design aims to reduce uncertainty in plant behaviour, controllers in HWIL simulators must instead match simulator behaviour to the behaviour of the real object, which are both sensitive to the underlying uncertainty in the hardware. This represents a new design challenge that has not yet been addressed in the literature. The design method presented here is general and non-heuristic, and is applicable to a large class of uncertain, non-linear systems. The method is based on the computation of a sub-optimal solution to an optimisation over the space of possible controllers. Experimental results are presented that verify the practicality of the design method.","0191-2216","978-1-4244-1497-0","978-1-4244-1498-7","10.1109/CDC.2007.4434660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4434660","","Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Control design;Control system synthesis;Design methodology;Hardware;Nonlinear control systems;Software design;System testing;Uncertainty","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;nonlinear control systems;uncertain systems","HWIL simulator;closed loop behaviour;control system design;uncertain nonlinear hardware-in-the-loop simulator","","","","0","","9","","","20080121","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

For guaranteeing timing properties, the standard practice is to use various analysis techniques provided by hard real-time scheduling theory. The paper presents analysis based on simulation, that considers the effects of faults and timing parameter variations on schedulability analysis, and its impact on the reliability estimation of the system. We look at a wider set of scenarios than just the worst case considered in hard real-time schedulability analysis. The ideas have general applicability, but the method has been developed with modelling the effects of external interferences on the controller area network (CAN) in mind. We illustrate the method by showing that a CAN interconnected distributed system, subjected to external interference, may be proven to satisfy its timing requirements with a sufficiently high probability, even in cases when the worst-case analysis has deemed it non-schedulable.","","0-7803-7241-7","","10.1109/ETFA.2001.996375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996375","","Automotive engineering;Costs;Dynamic scheduling;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Interference;Job shop scheduling;Performance analysis;Real time systems;Timing","controller area networks;digital simulation;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;field buses;real-time systems;reliability;safety-critical software;scheduling","CAN interconnected distributed system;controller area network;cost perspective;distributed real-time systems;hardware faults;per-unit cost;reliability;safety-critical real-time systems;schedulability analysis;simulation based approach;software faults;timing guarantees","","","","0","","","","","20020807","15 Oct 2001-18 Oct 2001","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hierarchical dependability model allows expressing multiple redundancies made at multiple levels of a system decomposed to multiple cooperating blocks. A hierarchical dependability model based on Markov chains allows each block and relations between these blocks to be expressed independently by Markov chains. This allows a decomposition of a complex dependability model into multiple small models to be made. The decomposed model is easier to read, understand and modify. A hazard rate is calculated significantly faster using hierarchical model, because the decomposition allows exponential calculation-time explosion to be avoided. The paper shows a method how to reduce Markov chains and use them to create hierarchical dependability models. An example study is used to demonstrate the advantages of the hierarchical dependability models (the decomposition of the complex model into multiple simple models and the speedup of the hazard rate calculation).","","978-1-4799-0595-9","","10.1109/LATW.2013.6562660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562660","","","Markov processes;hazards;hierarchical systems;safety-critical software","Markov chains;casualties;hazard state;hierarchical dependability models;injuries;multiple cooperating blocks;safety","","","","0","","8","","","20130718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","6-10 March 2006","2006","1","","1","2","Automotive systems are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to design successfully as the market demands increasing complexity. Body electronics are particularly affected by this trend, a good example being power windows design. This seemingly mundane area involves meeting market and legislative requirements, which means creating a control system that combines the input from several sensors and follows complex behavioral rules (Prabhu and Mosterman, 2004). Traditional design methodologies involve writing a text specification and implementing algorithms in C. However, algorithms cannot be verified without hardware. This approach leaves the engineer in the unenviable position of waiting for the last piece of hardware to arrive to enable them to test their system. To avoid these problems, engineers need to decouple algorithm development and verification from the availability of hardware.

Complex, embedded real-time control systems typically have a very large grain task model upon which hard and soft timing constraints are simultaneously imposed. Often, such systems are required to function in extremely hostile and unpredictable environments. This demands large dependability and availability in a continuous manner We describe a new paradigm to build such systems which is based on the notion of paths-the granularity at which the notion of time is expressed in software. Further the paper describes distributed middleware services that are being developed to provide dependable, adaptive dynamic resource management. To illustrate the approach, an automobile air bag control system is used as an application example. Path descriptions can be applied in system design or system maintenance and during run time optimization. Within this framework, model based evaluation is often required. Therefore, in the second part of the paper a modeling approach for paths based on Stochastic Petri Nets is described, and results of a performance evaluation are presented","","0-8186-7889-5","","10.1109/ECBS.1997.581928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581928","","Availability;Buildings;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Distributed control;Middleware;Real time systems;Scalability;Timing;Vehicle dynamics","Petri nets;automotive electronics;control system synthesis;control systems;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;performance evaluation;real-time systems;systems engineering","Stochastic Petri Nets;automobile air bag control system;dependability;distributed;distributed middleware;embedded;embedded real-time control systems;real-time control systems;scalability","","","","4","","8","","","20020806","24 Mar 1997-28 Mar 1997","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

SmartC is a hierarchical modeling language and implements the SmartOSEK operating system model. The SmartC models are classified into four levels, namely module level, task level, subtask level and component level. In the SmartC models, control-flow oriented models and data-flow oriented models are integrated in the hybrid SmartC models. At the task level, the model is constructed based on the control flow, whereas the component level model is constructed based on the dataflow. In SmartC programs, all inter-task communication, task triggering mechanisms, and access to guarded global variables, are automatically generated by the SmartC generator which generates the C code from the SmartC code. Having well-structured concurrency mechanisms, SmartC greatly reduces the risk of concurrency errors, such as deadlock and race conditions. The SmartC language is implemented on the automated manual transmission (AMT) control system and is compatible with the OSEK/VDXspecifications. We use a continuous time (CT) model as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the language","","0-7695-2539-3","","10.1109/DASC.2006.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4030884","","Application software;Automatic control;Automotive electronics;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Control system synthesis;Embedded software;Embedded system;Operating systems;Software systems","automotive electronics;mechanical engineering computing;object-oriented programming;simulation languages","SmartC;SmartOSEK operating system;automated manual transmission;automotive electronics;component level;component-based hierarchical modeling language;continuous time model;control-flow oriented models;data-flow oriented models;intertask communication;module level;subtask level;task level;task triggering mechanisms","","","","2","","13","","","20061219","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

ETC for passenger cars is a safety-critical, embedded control system and it must meet very high reliability and safety requirements. ETC systems continue to increase in complexity, making formal specification and verification processes an essential component of the development of safer systems. There are two ways to represent the real-time system. Firstly, we can describe the system's structure and function by detailing its electrical, mechanical, and other components. Secondly, the real-time system's behavior as it responds to actions and events can be described. Then we can compare the system's specification to the safety assertion to show that the system meets the safety properties. This paper describes two research threads. In the first, we present the specification of Toyota's electronic throttle control (ETC) system including the timing constraints. The second thread, which will be explored in a longer version of this paper, evaluates the use of conventional design versus electronic engine control by applying classical control theory.","","978-1-4244-9494-1","","10.1109/SYSCON.2011.5929080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929080","","Assembly;Engines;Real time systems;Safety;Steady-state;Timing;Unified modeling language","automotive electronics;control engineering computing;embedded systems;engines;formal specification;formal verification;mechanical engineering computing;road safety;safety-critical software","ETC system;Toyota electronic throttle controller;formal specification;formal verification;passenger car;real-time system;reliability;safety;safety-critical embedded control system;timing constraints","","","","0","","11","","","20110623","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our field of application, we additionally suffer from the lack of knowledge on system internals like the source code. Therefore, our approach is based on dependences between the components of embedded systems. The model we use is derived from the system architecture and system requirements.

The occurrence of faults can result in shared resources, such as processors or networks, being overloaded. The goal of this effort is to provide a benefit based scheduling approach that facilitates operations under overload conditions. A key feature of this approach is the ability to detect the occurrence of faults prior to an overload by leveraging unused capacity. A benefit based scheduler that considers importance, system state, and timeliness is used to order processing once faults have been detected. This approach can be easily fitted to classical deadline based scheduling policies, such as rate monotonic or earliest deadline first, and causes no significant increase in algorithm complexity.

For an early validation of vehicle functionalities special simulators are used for specific domains - like mechanics, electronics and software. To provide timely simulation and review for complete mechatronic components, these simulators need first to be coupled with one another, to have an interdisciplinary behavior.

Such an integration is critical for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) when model parts are independently developed by different teams as it is the case in multi-tier industries, e.g. avionics and automotive. Analysis algorithms play a central role augmenting the designer's capacity to automatically verify properties of interest in systems at the scale and complexity required by these industries. Unfortunately, the verification results are valid only if the assumptions of the different analysis algorithms (analytic assumptions) are consistent with each other. This paper presents our work on the automatic verification of one important class of analytic assumptions in OAR models: resource allocation assumptions. These assumptions are modeled as Resource Allocation (RA) contracts. RA contract constructs include not only the typical assumes and guarantees but also runtime facts and implications. Finally, we automatically determine the correct sequence of execution of the analysis algorithms based on the contract input/output dependencies described in our models. Together these characteristics enable the automatic assumption verification that preserves the scalability of analytic models. We illustrate our approach using an example model with analysis algorithms for security, schedulability, and energy efficiency.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064507","AADL;Assumption management;Cyber-Physical Systems;Design by Contract;Resource Allocation","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Contracts;Mathematical model;Resource management;Runtime;Unified modeling language","formal verification;resource allocation;scheduling;security of data;software architecture","CPS;OAR models;RA contracts;analysis algorithms;analytic assumptions;analytic interpretations;automatic assumption verification;automatic verification;cyber-physical systems;designers capacity;energy efficiency;multitier industry;open analytic runtime models;resource allocation assumptions;resource allocation contracts;runtime architectural models;runtime facts;schedulability;security","","","","0","","","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the increasing popularity of multicore processors, parallelization has also become important for other computing domains, such as desktops and embedded systems. Mission-critical embedded software, like that used in avionics and automotive industry, also needs to guarantee real time behavior. For that purpose, tools are needed to calculate the worst-case execution time (WCET) of tasks running on a processor, so that the real time system can make sure that real time guarantees are met. However, due to the shared resources present in a multicore system, this task is made much more difficult as compared to finding WCET for a single core processor.

Beside an internal toolset for linear analysis, nonlinear simulation, and optimization based on the system description language DSL, CAMeL has the possibility to use other, i.e., commercial, design environments to enhance its performance. In addition, CAMeL software processes are able to communicate online with technical processes.

To address this topic, several verification languages, methods and tools, which address several issues of the verification process, were developed by multiple EDA vendors over the last years. This paper takes an industrial user's point of view and explores the difficulties introducing new verification methods into a company's ""naturally grown"" and well established design flow - taking into account application domain specific requirements, constraints given by the existing design environment and economical aspects. The presented approach extends the capabilities of an existing verification strategy by powerful new features while keeping in mind integration, reuse and applicability aspects.

The design flow of such architectures consists of specifying control applications as Simulink/Stateflow models, followed by generating code from them and finally mapping such code onto multiple ECUs. In addition, the scheduling policies and parameters on both the ECUs and the communication buses over which they communicate also need to be specified. These policies and parameters are computed from high-level timing and control performance constraints. The proposed tutorial will cover different aspects of this design flow, with a focus on timing and schedulability problems. After reviewing the basic concepts of worst-case execution time analysis and schedulability analysis, we will discuss the differences between meeting timing constraints (as in classical real-time systems) and meeting control performance constraints (e.g., stability, steady and transient state performance). We will then describe various control performance related schedulability analysis techniques and how they may be tied to model-based software development. Finally, we will discuss various schedule synthesis techniques, both for ECUs as well as for communication protocols like FlexRay, so that control performance constraints specified at the model-level may be satisfied.

To support this, we specify a controlled natural language for the automotive domain. After acquiring the requirements they are translated into a formal model. The model enables an efficient reachability analysis and allows to describe rich temporal behavior. We then use partial order planning to create positive and negative tests. The resulting test cases are able to handle non-deterministic timing behavior.

Computer security can deliver the required protection mechanisms and sustain the according business models. We propose an approach to facilitate the rigorous checking of components for originality in a vehicle. In our system model, a security controller receives special messages (i.e., the authenticity heartbeat signal) from relevant ECUs and it performs subsequent authentication and plausibility checks. As a result, the security controller can tell, if the current setup of components in the vehicle is original. We evaluate our authentication architecture for the Battery Management System (BMS) of a hybrid car. Here, the security controller detects reliably, if the BMS is an original component, and whether an attacker has modified the operational limits of the battery. In this paper, we reason that an effective copy protection scheme needs to fuse relevant information from different sources. Therefore, various security techniques have to be combined in a sound architectural approach. The distinctive feature of our architecture is that it takes into account application-specific knowledge of the real-time entities under control.","","978-1-4673-0312-5","","10.1109/INDIN.2012.6301060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301060","","Authentication;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Protocols;Software;Vehicles","automobile industry;automotive electronics;battery management systems;control engineering computing;copy protection;industrial property;message authentication","BMS;ECU;aftersales market;application-specific knowledge;authentication architecture;authenticity heartbeat signals;automotive electronic control units;automotive supplier market;battery management system;business models;component checking;computer security;copy protection scheme;hybrid car;intellectual property rights protection;operational limits;plausibility checks;protection mechanisms;real-time entity;relevant information;security controller;security techniques","","","","0","","30","","","20120913","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its hardware consists of a simulation computer, a monitor computer, a vision computer, DAS actuators as well as a dummy car. Its software components include several specific ones. When designing its monitor software, a GUI-Driven-by-S-Function (GUIDSF) method is proposed to eliminate the delay in the displaying of the simulation data. The vision rendering software uses adjustment based on the principle of optical projection, considerably improving the driver's perception of being immersed in the virtual traffic scene. The success of the developed platform is demonstrated by HIL experiments of actuators and DIL experiments of ACC.

Using this approach requirement recording can be done on the project level as well as on a lower level, e.g. the level of a single car variant. To support an intensive reuse of requirement models the domain engineering approach is adapted to requirements engineering in that application domain. The methodology supports the recording of requirements on the project level or lower and the reuse of established requirement structures of the domain for a new application and it shows a way of how requirement structures of an application can be made available for further reuse in the domain. In addition, different consistency checks are supported.","1090-705X","0-7695-1465-0","","10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048533","","Automotive engineering;Design engineering;Engineering management;Knowledge engineering;Project management;Research and development management;Software development management;Software systems;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","automated highways;formal specification;formal verification;software reusability;systems analysis","automotive sector;car;consistency checks;domain engineering approach;requirement model reuse;requirement recording;requirements engineering;series development","","","","0","","","","","20021210","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This project investigated which alternative provides the optimum Bradley weapons system. The client was interested in the weapon performance over a variety of terrains and mission profiles. In order to reduce the number of combinations of design variables, Pythagoras, an agent-based model was employed to investigate the optimum burst size for each weapon. Then a high resolution combat model, JCATS, will be employed to examine the performance of the candidate systems as compared to the current system.

An MRAC vehicle suspension can thus accommodate for variances in sprung load and suspension component characteristics. An MRAC was designed using Lyapunov stability approach and was tested using different scenarios such as Â±10% to Â±30% variances of suspension components and sprung load. It is shown that the MRAC suspension closely followed the performance of the prespecified reference model and achieve significant improvements over passive suspension.

However, analog circuit behaviors are so tightly intertwined with their environment that: 1) abstractions needed for model-based design are often not accurate, thus making it difficult to achieve reliable system performance estimations, and 2) generic, design-independent interfaces that are needed to develop compositional techniques are very difficult to define. In this paper, we propose a platform-based design methodology that uses analog contracts to develop reliable abstractions and design-independent interfaces. A contract explicitly handles pairs of properties, representing the assumptions on the environment and the promises of a component under these assumptions. Horizontal contracts encode composition rules that constrain how library elements should be “legally” used. Vertical contracts define under which conditions an aggregation of components satisfies the requirements posed at a higher level of abstraction. If both sets of contracts are satisfied, we can produce implementations by composition and refinement that are correct by construction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the design of an ultra-wide band receiver used in an Intelligent Tire system, an on-vehicle wireless sensor network for active safety applications.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2012.2211098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6259825","Analog and mixed-signal design;automotive sensor interfaces;contract-based design;integrated sensor interface modeling;platform-based design;ultrawideband","Analog circuits;Computational modeling;Contracts;Integrated circuit modeling;Libraries;Mathematical model;Optimization","analogue integrated circuits;automotive electronics;integrated circuit design;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;performance evaluation;radio receivers;road safety;software architecture;tyres;ultra wideband communication;wireless sensor networks","active safety applications;analog circuit behaviors;analog contracts;analog integrated interface design;composition rules;compositional methods;design-independent interfaces;horizontal contracts;intelligent tire system;library elements;model-based design;model-based development;on-vehicle wireless sensor network;platform-based design methodology;reliable abstractions;reliable system performance estimation;ultra-wide band receiver design;vertical contracts","","","","1","","66","","2012-08-03","20121016","","IEEE","IEEE Sensors Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The synergetic integration of mechanical processes, microelectronics and information processing opens new possibilities for process design as well as for automatic control. The solution of tasks within mechatronic systems is performed on the process side and the digital-electronic side. As the interrelations during the design play an important role, engineering must be simultaneous from the very beginning. Mechatronic systems are developed for mechanical elements, machines, vehicles and precision mechanic devices. The integration of mechatronic systems can be performed by the components (hardware-integration) and by information processing (software-integration). The information processing consists of low-level and high-level feedback control, supervision and diagnosis and general process management. Special signal processing, model based and adaptive methods are applied. With the aid of a knowledge base and inference mechanisms mechatronic systems with increasing intelligence will be developed. The main goals are to increase systems performance, reliability and economy, and production costs. Some examples for the development of mechatronic systems are shown, e.g. active damping of oscillations of mechanical drives, hydraulic pipes and vehicle suspensions, control of machine tools with force reconstruction, smart actuators and supervision and fault diagnosis for automobiles.","","0-7803-4080-9","","10.1109/AIM.1997.652972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=652972","","Automatic control;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Design engineering;Information processing;Intelligent actuators;Mechatronics;Microelectronics;Process design;Vehicles","automobiles;feedback;inference mechanisms;intelligent control;mechatronics;model reference adaptive control systems;signal processing","adaptive methods;automobiles;diagnosis;hardware-integration;high-level feedback control;inference mechanisms;information processing;knowledge base;low-level feedback control;machines;mechanical processes;mechatronic systems;microelectronics;model-based methods;process management;signal processing;software-integration;supervision;synergetic integration","","","","1","1","","","","20020806","16 Jun 1997-20 Jun 1997","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) dominates the application domain meaning that they are established as the most popular industrial controllers used in factory and shop floor. Although the capabilities of these controllers have strongly improved in the last decades, their historical background as the easy understand by the electricians who had previously worked on electrical systems has meant that the de-facto standard for the implementation of control and monitoring solution for these devices remains the ladder logic. However, to face the globalization challenges, the manufacturing companies needs to improve their productivity by reducing the costs, delivering high-quality of products with high variety and improving their responsiveness to changing market condition. Moreover productivity gains can also be achieved by reducing the life-cycle costs of manufacturing production systems implying the using of more flexible and agile approaches. In this scenario, the proposed methodology aims to provide a homogeneous and optimum process that, starting from a set of mechanical specifications and behavioural models of machines, enable the generation of industrial logic automatically ensuring the same structure and naming standard in every project and the quality of the code.","","","","10.1109/SMC.2013.657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722410","Automotive Industry;Behavioural Modelling;Design Methodology;IEC-61131-3;Programmable Logic Controller","","","","","","","","","","","","20140127","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this domain, the devices are the performance bottlenecks, not the communication systems. Throughout the vehicle life cycle, parts of the software have to be frequently updated during maintenance. Today, the software of the devices is updated in a consecutive manner. Due to performance bottlenecks caused by the affected devices, the update can take a long time that leads to high costs. Therefore, the objective is to reduce the total update time by a higher utilization of the common bus resource. In this paper, we introduce and investigate algorithms that update the software of multiple devices simultaneously and evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms. We focus on scheduling algorithms on the Application layer and the logical link control (LLC) layer and model the update process by means of Petri nets.

However, they bare a high risk of containing incompatibilities between components, due to the lack of control over the integration-relevant aspects of their components. Current development processes are able to detect incompatibilities between components only at very late stages of system development. The Virtual Integration methodology is an approach to detect and to solve compatibility issues during early stages of system design. The methodology supports developers with a set of measures to reduce the risk of incompatibilities to a minimum at each abstraction layer of their system architecture. Realtime requirements of embedded systems make it necessary to support the methodology with a formal model, which can describe dynamic properties of these systems. In our approach, we use interface automata because they offer a lightweight formalism to describe the behavior of components and to verify their compatibility based on these descriptions. In a feasibility study we show, to which extend interface automata are adequate for the foresaid purpose in the automotive application field.","","978-1-4244-5715-1","","10.1109/WISES.2010.5548424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548424","","Automata;Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Embedded software;Embedded system;Laboratories;Real time systems;Software safety;Vehicle dynamics","automata theory;embedded systems;object-oriented programming;program verification;user interfaces","behavioral compatibility verification;component based systems;embedded systems;generic components;integration relevant aspects;realtime requirements;virtual integration methodology","","","","0","","10","","","20100816","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our educational material can cover both, the concept of real-time OS and implementation of application. Usually we evaluate real-time OS with using microprocessor boards. However, microcomputer boards are difficult to keep using as educational materials because companies of microcomputer boards often change their specification of boards or discontinue products. Therefore, we use cygwin, which is UNIX environment working on Microsoft Windows OS, for simulation environment. Students do not need to prepare any actual equipment. We choose OSEK/VDX OS for real-time OS. Students can work OSEK/VDX OS on cygwin. We developed “Live cygwin” which can execute cygwin applications directly from CD ROM without installing on the PC. OSEK/VDX is an open standard specification developed for automotive embedded software in Europe. As executable code of OSEK/VDX OS on cygwin environment, we use TOPPERS ATK. TOPPERS ATK (Automotive Kernel) is open source code implemented of OSEK/VDX OS by TOPPERS (Toyohashi Open Platform for Embedded Real-Time Systems). And we developed UML documentations of OSEK/VDX OS.

To match challenging Time to Market constraints (less than 18 months for a new application) versus Automotive functions complexity increasing, without sacrificing system quality and robustness, a new approach appears unavoidable, perhaps a change of paradigm, where relationships and cooperation between Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) and Suppliers as well as Supplier to Supplier interfacing have to evolve into a new model for both development and commercial issues.

This knowledge is essential for applications like the envisaged collision mitigation. However, current off-the-shelf single sensor approaches cannot always fulfil these challenging demands. Therefore, in our work we develop a multi sensor approach to examine the capabilities of early sensor data fusion. The term ""early fusion"" derives from a model-based fusion concept, which relies on only slightly pre-processed data and thus provides the possibility of consolidated and integrative sensor data interpretation. Contrary to track-based fusion the sensor data are merged in an early stage of the processing chain to preserve most of the environmental information content and therefore to tap almost the full sensor potential.

In the case of software, the program is simply run with the appropriate inputs, and in the case of hardware, its description written in a hardware description language (HDL) is simulated with the appropriate input vectors. In coverage-directed validation, coverage metrics are defined that quantitatively measure the degree of verification coverage of the design. Motivated by recent work on observability-based coverage metrics for models described in a hardware description language, we develop a method that computes an observability-based code coverage metric for embedded software written in a high-level programming language. Given a set of input vectors, our metric indicates the instructions that had no effect on the output. An assignment that was not relevant to generate the output value cannot be considered as being covered. Results show that our method offers a significantly more accurate assessment of design verification coverage than statement coverage.

Architecture-level engineering practice demands notations, which concentrate on certain aspects of system functionality, while other aspects (such as communication and scheduling) are implicitly encoded in the language semantics, and realized using HW/SW components such as operating systems and protocol stacks. We describe a system-level design methodology targeted for automotive control applications. Models in a simple graphical component-based input language are compiled into complex system models incorporating abstractions for hardware, operating systems, and inter-processor communication. System models are based on the synchronous AutoFocus notation and are used as a basis for formal analysis such as systematic worst-case response time analysis.

Kennedy Carter, along with its partners in two EU-funded research programs, has accepted the challenge of creating the definitive integrated development environment for embedded automotive software for the first decade of this century (2000-2010). The vision that informs these two projects is the need for an integrated development environment conforming to an open systems/software architecture. Part of that vision is that the algorithmic, control theoretic emphasis of much software development in the automotive industry hitherto will not be sufficient to manage the scale and complexity of the software challenge that the industry faces. Thus, tools such as MATRIXx and MatLab must be augmented by tools which have been proven in large scale telecommunications and aerospace projects and which support the separation of concerns, rapid prototyping, co-design and code generation. Kennedy Carter is now able to offer an integrated development environment (IDE), comprising the I-UML, I-SIM/RT and I-CCG products. Used in conjunction with MATRIXx from Integrated Systems, or MatLab/Simulink from The Mathworks, these products are able to realise the vision.

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of SHSs are generated utilizing a commercial CFD software package. The CFD analysis evaluates the cooling performance as well as the basic thermal behavior of the SHSs under various parametric conditions such as heat dissipations ranging from 5 to 20W, air velocities ranging from 0 to 3m/s, and fin spaces of 12, 15, and 20mm. The cooling performance of the SHSs is compared with those of conventional pin fin heat sinks (PHSs). Parametric study has found that thermal resistances of the SHSs are typically smaller than those of the PHSs; for example, they are 15% smaller than the PHS under natural convection. Parametric results show that 15mm is the best fin space for SHSs. This study also explores the effect of the declination angles between the symmetry axis of the fin and the axis of the gravity on the performance of HPFs under natural convection.

Fifth IEEE International Workshop on","2000","2000","","","127","130","The “PICAR” project is based on “Prometheus Prochip” experience and results. The goal is to design an embedded multi sensors collision avoidance system for automotive application. The system includes sensors like video camera, ultrasonic sensors, a PC hardware computer, a CAN<sup>2</sup> network and a dedicated software for signal and image processing, data fusion and AI expert system. The design of such a system is difficult under real time constraints. Therefore, a simulator is a good solution to test different parts of the system and then to help to choose the overall architecture. However simulating all the embedded architecture in real-time becomes a very complex work. It is necessary to have an environment simulator where sensors can be virtually implemented. The data are then processed leading to results without hardware costs. The designed environment software allows the simulation of physical sensors, and also the emulation of these sensors. The simulator is interfaced to the physical embedded hardware by a network bridge. So, we can emulate some sensors to experiment data processing on the physical embedded PICAR computer. This paper presents the physical smart car PICAR and its embedded system, the virtual world simulator. We explain how we can mix the virtual world (produced by virtual sensors) and real world (physical embedded system) to implement some scenarios (like automatic parking) and to validate the physical architecture.

With the availability of wireless communication in vehicles, information can be transmitted from vehicles to allow historical or fleet comparisons. New networked applications can be created that, e.g., monitor if the behavior of a certain system in a vehicle deviates compared to the system behavior observed in a fleet. This allows a new approach to fault detection that can help reduce development costs of fault detection software and create vehicle individual service planning. The COSMO (consensus self-organized modeling) methodology described in this paper creates a compact representation of the data observed for a subsystem or component in a vehicle. A representation that can be sent to a server in a backoffice and compared to similar representations for other vehicles. The backoffice server can collect representations from a single vehicle over time or from a fleet of vehicles to define a norm of the vehicle condition. The vehicle condition can then be monitored, looking for deviations from the norm. The method is demonstrated for measurements made on a real truck driven in varied conditions with ten different generated faults. The proposed method is able to detect all cases without prior information on what a fault looks like or which signals to use.","","978-1-4244-3827-3","978-1-4244-3828-0","10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5117980","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Availability;Costs;Fault detection;Hardware;Mechatronics;Monitoring;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data mining;network servers;radio networks;software fault tolerance;telecommunication computing;traffic engineering computing","automated fault detection software;backoffice server;consensus self-organized modeling methodology;mechatronic system;networked vehicles;vehicle condition;wireless communication","","","","0","","4","","","20090626","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analysis is performed by means of Markov models that allow quantifying the effect of dormant faults and other vital reliability parameters. It turns out that the presence of dormant faults can drastically reduce the MTTF of a system, particularly if the operating system allows a sporadic (""event-driven"") change from a regular mode of operation to another mode. Virtually every practical system involves such a change, at least in case of emergency. It is demonstrated that on-line built-in self-test (BIST) is an effective means to overcome the deteriorating effect of dormant faults and re-establish a high MTTF. A very moderate test period may already be sufficient.

While formalizing a real-world requirements document, we developed a technique where not states but signal patterns are the main elements. We argue that it supports a formalization that is often closer to the informal requirements and thus provides a smoother transition to formal methods. As only tables of regular expressions are used for notation, the technique can easily be understood by non-mathematicians.

A key component of the toolset is a reconfigurable engineering design simulator that can be used to model cockpit display concepts quickly and easily. This simulator uses Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS) technology to evaluate systems under consideration. This paper provides a detailed description of the engineering design simulator.

Players may be moving airborne or ground-based vehicles such as aircraft, tanks or armored personnel carriers; or may be static, such as surface-to-air-missile (SAM) site or anti-aircraft battery. The development and rapid prototyping of new cockpit configurations, as well as the simulation of existing cockpit configurations and aircraft are all possible with the engineering design simulator. This simulator ensures that the crew-centered development and validation of new cockpit configurations can be performed under realistic, adverse, and/or high workload conditions.

International Conference on","28 June-1 July 2005","2005","","","486","495","Designing a distributed fault tolerance algorithm requires careful analysis of both fault models and diagnosis strategies. A system will fail if there are too many active faults, especially active Byzantine faults. But, a system will also fail if overly aggressive convictions leave inadequate redundancy. For high reliability, an algorithm's hybrid fault model and diagnosis strategy must be tuned to the types and rates of faults expected in the real world. We examine this balancing problem for two common types of distributed algorithms: clock synchronization and group membership. We show the importance of choosing a hybrid fault model appropriate for the physical faults expected by considering two clock synchronization algorithms. Three group membership service diagnosis strategies are used to demonstrate the benefit of discriminating between permanent and transient faults. In most cases, the probability of failure is dominated by one fault type. By identifying the dominant cause of failure, one can tailor an algorithm appropriately at design time, yielding significant reliability gain.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467823","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automotive engineering;Clocks;Distributed algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Protocols;Redundancy;Synchronization","distributed algorithms;fault diagnosis;software reliability;synchronisation","Byzantine fault;clock synchronization;design time reliability analysis;distributed fault tolerance algorithm;failure probability;fault diagnosis;group membership service;hybrid fault model","","","","3","","39","","","20050725","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attributes (i) and (ii) are subjected to the comparison of baseline, reference, and actual values of corresponding parameters of vehicle dynamics like acceleration, yaw rate, slip and others. The attribute (iii) links to the choice of weighting factors from the analysis of vehicle maneuvers. Application fields of the developed individual and complex cost functions are assessment of vehicle performance and stability, optimization of relevant control systems, and choice of proper control strategies / tuning of control gains by autonomous or cooperative operation of several systems of vehicle dynamics control.

This paper presents one step of such a strategy that focuses on the design activity. A well-known model-based design approach from the automotive domain is extended by the concept of variability and decision modeling.

In this paper, we present an automatic transformation from discrete-time Matlab/Simulink to the input language of UCLID. UCLID is a toolkit for system verification based on SMT solving. Our approach enables us to use a combination of bounded model checking and inductive invariant checking for the automatic verification of Matlab/Simulink models.

The study's findings give rise to the Motive-Technology-Belief (MTB) framework, a theory that conceives of technology adoption in terms of three mental structures: motives are inner mental reasons; technologies are tools that pertain to motives; and beliefs are associations between motives and/or technologies. Their behavioral interactions are governed by three conscious processes: selecting is the process of choosing a tool in response to an immediate need; evaluating is the process of forming beliefs about tools; and maintaining is the process of determining the functional status of tools. They are augmented by five unconscious auxiliary processes: perceiving, focusing, framing, consolidating, and acting. The primary contribution of the paper is a framework for a causal adoption process theory that is solidly grounded in empirical observations and prior literature, and is well-suited to guide the construction of simulated consumer agents. The theory establishes a foundation for agent-based market simulation that gives new product development and service innovation managers improved ability to forecast emerging market conditions.","","978-1-890843-20-5","978-1-890843-20-5","10.1109/PICMET.2009.5261820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261820","","Automotive engineering;Predictive models;Psychology;Size measurement;Software engineering;Solid modeling;Technological innovation;Technology management;Transportation;Vehicles","innovation management;technology management;transportation","agent-based market simulation;auxiliary process;black box;causal adoption process theory;motive technology belief framework;product development;service innovation;simulated consumer agent;technology adoption;transportation consumers","","","","1","","55","","","20090925","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key objective of KARYON is to provide system solutions for predictable and safe coordination of smart vehicles that autonomously cooperate and interact in an open and inherently uncertain environment. One of the main challenges is to ensure high performance levels of vehicular functionality in the presence of uncertainties and failures. This paper describes some of the steps being taken in KARYON to address this challenge, from the definition of a suitable architectural pattern to the development of proof-of-concept prototypes intended to show the applicability of the KARYON solutions. The project proposes a safety architecture that exploits the concept of architectural hybridization to define systems in which a small local safety kernel can be built for guaranteeing functional safety along a set of safety rules. KARYON is also developing a fault model and fault semantics for distributed, continuous-valued sensor systems, which allows abstracting specific sensor faults and facilitates the definition of safety rules in terms of quality of perception. Solutions for improved communication predictability are proposed, ranging from network inaccessibility control at lower communication levels to protocols for assessment of cooperation state at the process level. KARYON contributions include improved simulation and fault-injection tools for evaluating safety assurance according to the ISO 26262 safety standard.

It should be realized in the process of modifying mould-obtaining 3D model by reverse engineering-testing errors-confirming model. This thesis applies the method of ATOS Optical Scanner and CMM (Three-Coordinate Measuring Machine) to obtain the complete high-precision point cloud data because of the complicated free form surface of automobile model. It is difficult to have error evaluation because the CAD model and the point cloud data are impossible to make automatic alignment. Therefore, on the basis of the surface reconstruction of reverse engineering software Imageware and the comparative functions between surface and point cloud data, we propose a new perspective of detecting digital error, i.e. the contour adjustment of surface automatically by the way of golden section method. Under the condition of satisfying the least square method, this method, which can make anastomosis for the actual and theoretical surface, reduces and even eliminates the position error caused by the inconsistency between the actual reference and CAD model reference, laying a foundation to measure shape error by the way of direct alignment method and reducing time as well as improving the error detection precision. Being simplistic, effective and practical, this method has been successfully utilized in the female die design of interior plastic trimming for a certain type of Shanghai Volkswagen car, having great reference value in terms of the automatization, flexibility and digitalization of products on-line detection.","","978-1-4244-3290-5","978-1-4244-3291-2","10.1109/CAIDCD.2008.4730649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4730649","Digitalization;Direct Alignment Method;Error Detection;Golden Section Method;Reverse Engineering;The Least Square Method","Automobiles;Clouds;Coordinate measuring machines;Design automation;Image reconstruction;Least squares methods;Microassembly;Reverse engineering;Shape measurement;Surface reconstruction","CAD;automotive engineering;error detection;least squares approximations;reverse engineering","CMM;Imageware;anastomosis;automobile die;complex freeform surface;direct alignment method;error detection;least square method;mould;optical scanner;reverse engineering;surface reconstruction;three-coordinate measuring machine","","","","0","","8","","","20081230","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed smart charger consists of four-leg IGBTs. Three legs are used for a single-phase full-bridge-based PWM rectifier, which converts power from ac to dc during the battery-charging operation, or from dc to ac during the battery-discharging operation. This PWM rectifier can compensate reactive and unbalanced active currents on single-phase three-wire distribution systems because the third leg is connected to the neutral line of single-phase three-wire distribution feeders. The fourth leg is used as a bidirectional dc-dc converter for battery-charging and discharging operations. The three-leg PWM rectifier uses only constant dc-capacitor voltage control, which is commonly used in active power line conditioners. Thus, the authors have developed the simplest possible control method for a single-phase power quality compensator. The basic principle of the proposed smart charger is discussed in detail, and then confirmed by digital computer simulation using PSIM software. A prototype experimental model is constructed and tested. Experimental results demonstrate that balanced source currents are obtained on the secondary side of the pole-mounted distribution transformer for battery-charging and discharging operations.","","978-1-4673-0802-1","978-1-4673-0801-4","10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6342512","bidirectional dc-dc converter;constant dc-capacitor voltage control;single-phase PLL circuit;single-phase d-q transformation;single-phase three-wire distribution system;smart charger;three-leg inverter","Legged locomotion;Rectifiers;Switches","PWM rectifiers;automotive electrics;battery chargers;battery powered vehicles;insulated gate bipolar transistors;power supply quality;voltage control","DC capacitor voltage control;IGBT;active power line conditioner;battery charging operation;battery discharging operation;electric vehicle;reactive current;single phase full bridge PWM rectifier;single phase power quality compensator;single phase three wire distribution feeders;smart charger","","","","0","","13","","","20121110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, until now fault models other than the stuck-at fault model have rarely been used in emulation.

Although different in logical implementation and physical abstraction level, all fault models are administered and applied together and can even be mixed in a single fault grading campaign. The proposed fault emulation environment is not restricted in its use to a certain emulator. The modular approach proposed in this paper allows an easy adaption for different emulation systems and reuse of all key components including the fault models. Those may be applied during fault grading campaigns as well as in-circuit emulation.

The main goal of this framework is to achieve the model interchange among CASE tools. This framework adds the CASE tools issues to the definitions of the model languages. The presented framework contains four internal metamodels. Firstly, a metamodel specifies the abstract syntax of the model language. Secondly, another metamodel specifies the particular elements for the connection-based languages. Thirdly, a metamodel specifies the spatial information. At last, a metamodel defines the necessary elements for the CASE tools. Each internal metamodel can be changed without having effect on the others. These four internal metamodels can be combined in several ways (denoted as configurations). Each configuration has its particular scope. The presented framework has been already used for defining the INGENIAS language and modernising the INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK).

Driver's fatigue, drowsiness, inattention, and distraction are reported a major causal factor in many traffic accidents. Due to the drivers lost their attention, they had markedly reduced the perception, recognition and vehicle control abilities. In recent years, many computational intelligent technologies were developed for preventing traffic accidents caused by driver's inattention. Driver's drowsiness and distraction related studies had become a major interest research topic in automotive safety engineering. Many researches had investigated the driving cognition in cognitive neuro-engineering, but how to utilize the main findings of driving-related cognitive researches in traditional cognitive neuroscience and integrate with computational intelligence technologies for augmenting driving performance will become a big challenge in the interdisciplinary research area. For this reason, we attempt to integrate the driving cognition for real life application in this study. The implications of the driving cognition in cognitive neuroscience and computational intelligence for daily applications are also demonstrated through two common attention related driving studies: (1) cognitive state monitoring of the driver performing the realistic long-term driving tasks in a simulated realistic driving environment; and (2) to extract the brain dynamic changes of driver's distraction effect during dual task driving. Experimental results of these studies provide new insights into the understanding of complex brain functions of participants actively performing ordinary tasks in natural body positions and situations within real operational environments.","1556-603X","","","10.1109/MCI.2009.934559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5294936","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Cognition;Competitive intelligence;Computational intelligence;Fatigue;Neuroscience;Road accidents;Safety;Vehicle driving","accident prevention;brain models;cognition;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;road safety","attention related driving study;automotive safety engineering;brain dynamic change extraction;cognitive neuro-engineering;cognitive neuroscience;cognitive state monitoring;complex brain function;computational intelligent brain computer interaction;drivers drowsiness;drivers fatigue;driving cognition;dual task driving;simulated realistic driving environment;traffic accident prevention;vehicle control ability","","","","6","","58","","","20091030","","IEEE","IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

EAST-ADL, an automotive specific architectural description language dedicated to safety-critical embedded control systems, has been proposed to harness this complexity. However, the current concept of EAST-ADL provides limited support for modeling and analysis of ERT behaviors due to the absence of energy constraints modeling notations and the lack of formal semantics. In this paper, we tackle that shortcoming by extending EAST-ADL notation with energy constraints and integrating the extension with formal analysis techniques based on ERT constraints. A mapping strategy is proposed to facilitate the guarantee of integration.

However, there remains an open issue: to what extent can a development process based on a singular formal notation and method succeed. The majority of approaches demonstrate a low level of flexibility by attempting to use a single notation to express all of the different aspects encountered in software development. Often, these approaches leave a number of scalability issues open. We prefer a more eclectic approach. In our experience, the use of a formalism-based toolkit with adequate notations for each development phase is a viable solution. Following this principle, any specific notation is used only where and when it is really suitable and not necessarily over the entire software lifecycle. The approach explored in this article is perhaps slowly emerging in practice - we hope to accelerate its adoption. However, the major challenge is still finding the best way to instantiate it for each specific application scenario. In this work, we describe a development process and method for automotive applications which consists of five phases. The process recognizes the need for having adequate (and tailored) notations (Problem Frames, Requirements State Machine Language, and Event-B) for each development phase as well as direct traceability between the documents produced during each phase. This allows for a stepwise verification/validation of the system under development. The ideas for the formal development method have evolved over two significant case studies carried out in the DEPLOY project.","","","","10.1109/FormaliSE.2013.6612275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612275","","Abstracts;Computers;Concrete;Engines;Mathematical model;Software;Vehicles","automobiles;formal verification;traffic engineering computing","automotive applications;formalism-based toolkit;singular formal notation;software development process;software lifecycle;stepwise validation;stepwise verification","","","","0","","27","","","20130926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Natural Interaction is the metaphor people encounter in reality: the direct manipulation of objects by their hands. To enable this kind of Natural Interaction, we propose a pseudophysical metaphor that is both plausible enough to provide realistic interaction and robust enough to meet the needs of industrial applications. Our analysis of the most common types of objects in typical automotive scenarios guided the development of a set of refined grasping heuristics to support robust finger-based interaction of multiple hands and users. The objects' behavior in reaction to the users' finger motions is based on pseudophysical simulations, which also take various types of constrained objects into account. In dealing with real-world scenarios, we had to introduce the concept of Normal Proxies, which extend objects with appropriate normals for improved grasp detection and grasp stability. An expert review revealed that our interaction metaphors allow for an intuitive and reliable assessment of several functionalities of objects found in a car interior. Follow-up user studies showed that overall task performance and usability are similar for CAVE and HMD environments. For larger objects and more gross manipulation, using the CAVE without employing a virtual hand representation is preferred, but for more fine-grained manipulation and smaller objects, the HMD turns out to be beneficial.","1077-2626","","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710906","3D graphics and realism;User interfaces;input/output devices;systems and software.","Computer graphics;Three dimensional displays;User interfaces","automotive components;automotive engineering;mechanical engineering computing;product development;virtual reality","CAVE;HMD;automotive product development processes;car interior;direct object manipulation;finger-based interaction;functional validations;multiple hands;natural interaction metaphors;normal proxies;object behavior;pseudophysical simulations;refined grasping heuristics;virtual car models;virtual hand representation","","","","2","","20","","2011-02-10","20110711","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, the user-level thread model has attracted attention of researchers. There have been many user-level thread libraries.

Industrial computing is rapidly moving towards systems that exhibit vast amounts of internal concurrency and communication, most visibly in many-core architectures, but equally important in the MilliWatt scale of embedded systems and the GigaWatt scale of cloud computing. The shift of focus from stand-alone systems connected through a network to collaborative computation in a network is going to shape the development of computer science for many decades to come, and constitutes a major methodological challenge for systems engineering. Practical solutions for these questions need to account not only for the inherent logical complexity of the systems, but also for the human engineers' natural inclination to apply sequential models in their informal reasoning, and industry's need to build reliable systems from reusable components. This setting strongly motivates the development of powerful tools which facilitate mathematically precise modeling on the one hand as well as computer-aided design and validation on the other.","","978-1-4244-5910-0","978-1-4244-5911-7","10.1109/SYNASC.2009.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460878","automotive software;avionic software;concurrent cloud computing;embedded systems;formal methods;model checking;testing","Cloud computing;Communication industry;Computer architecture;Computer industry;Concurrent computing;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Power system modeling;Reliability engineering;Systems engineering and theory","CAD;Internet;embedded systems;groupware;systems engineering","GigaWatt scale;MilliWatt scale;cloud computing;collaborative computation;computer science development;computer-aided design;embedded systems;formal methods;industrial computing;informal reasoning;logical complexity;reliable systems;sequential models;stand-alone systems;systems engineering","","","","0","","","","","20100506","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Test case generation constitutes a critical activity that is cost-intensive, time-consuming and error-prone when done manually. Hence, an automation of this process is required. One automation approach is search-based testing for which the task of generating test data is transformed into an optimization problem which is solved using metaheuristic search techniques. However, only little work has been done so far applying search-based testing techniques to continuous functional models, such as SIMULINK STATEFLOW models. This paper presents the current state of my thesis developing a new approach for automatically generating continuous test data sets achieving high structural model coverage for SIMULINK models containing STATEFLOW diagrams using search-based testing. The expected contribution of this work is to demonstrate how search-based testing techniques can be applied successfully to continuous functional models and how to cope with the arising problems such as generating and optimizing continuous signals, covering structural model elements and dealing with the complexity of the models.","","978-1-4244-3495-4","","10.1109/ICSE-COMPANION.2009.5071030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071030","","Automatic testing;Automation;Automotive engineering;Communication industry;Embedded software;Embedded system;Signal generators;Signal processing;Software testing;System testing","optimisation;program testing;systems analysis","Simulink models;Stateflow diagrams;model-based software design;optimization problem;search-based testing;systematic model testing;test case generation","","","","2","","8","","","20090612","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the issues is the problem of over-design and excessive weight of commercial motor vehicles. A manufacturer of ambulances has requested assistance on the evaluation and redesign of its ambulance coach. The manufacturer was interested in reducing the weight and the manufacturing cost of its present model. Due to the complexity of the structure, finite element analysis was used to determine stress distribution in its components. The entire coach was modeled using ANSYS finite element software. The results of the model showed low stresses and high safety factors for the present design. To reduce the weight, three other models of different structures were designed and analyzed. The results of models were then compared with the testing results of two independent testing companies and an optimum design was recommended to the manufacturer.","","0-7803-7296-4","","10.1109/IECEC.2002.1392140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392140","","Aluminum;Costs;Finite element methods;Fuels;Integral equations;Performance analysis;Stress;Testing;Vehicles;Virtual manufacturing","automotive engineering;cost reduction;environmental factors;finite element analysis;safety;structural engineering computing","ANSYS finite element software;ambulance structure;environmental issue;finite element analysis;fuel consumption;fuel price;manufacturing cost reduction;motor vehicle;safety factor;stress distribution;weight reduction analysis","","","","0","","","","","20050214","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The balanced feed system ensures not only good quality of plastic parts but also the consistency of quality of the plastic parts in the separate mould cavity. The balance of feed system in the multi-cavity mould depends on the layout of the cavities and runners. Taking a set of four-cavity injection mould for an example in this paper, the cavity layout is optimizedly designed and the optimized scheme of feed system is determined based on CAE simulation analysis on the two schemes of feed system using Moldflow software. Then the detailed structure of injection mould is designed. The cavity layout is reasonable and the mould structure is compact.

To avoid at least a part of these problems a general architecture can be planned within an organization to facilitate reuse. This offers benefits such as cost savings, lower redundancy, improved productivity and quality. Complexity increases significantly with use or reuse of external blocks, as they may not adhere to the internal architecture. Major challenges are in identifying the commonality of functionality, where the designs involve variability (ability to customize) within these blocks. The concept of a Software Product Line (SPL) largely addresses this issue. But in addition to variants, their versions/releases also play an important role for effective management over the entire product cycle from concept, design, development, test up to after sales maintenance. Moreover, to reduce the development time, processes to assist team members when choosing a component from the core assets is essential. Our proposal is based on the work with the industrial design tool named ESCAPE. It addresses the issues to identify commonality based on architecture, functionality and naming conventions in identification, specification and realization of variants within a product development as well as to assist the development team. As this tool in the discussed aspect follows the practices commonly used in industry, it can be seen as an example without limiting the general validity of the proposed process for variability management.","","978-1-4244-8068-5","978-0-7695-4181-5","10.1109/ICCGI.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628916","Embedded Systems;Software Configuration;Variability Management","Automotive engineering;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Hardware;Software;Unified modeling language","configuration management;product life cycle management;software architecture;software development management;software reusability","ESCAPE tool;complex embedded network;development team;development time;embedded system;functional block;general architecture;industrial design tool;large scale development;model-based variability management;organization;product cycle;product development;software configuration;software product line;software reuse;team member","","","","0","","14","","","20101111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current AIP architecture provides considerable flexibility in terms of modeling domain information and dynamically modifying it at run-time. This flexibility imposes further requirements on the installation and maintenance of applications because dependencies among its components change dynamically.

This paper presents a detailed hydraulic power steering model consisting of a steering cylinder, a rotary valve, a pump, a pressure relief valve, and hydraulic pipes, etc., and the model is established by AMESim software. The other mechanical parts of the vehicle such as the steering system, the suspension and the power train, etc., are built by ADAMS software. A co-simulation is carried out to study the steering stability of the vehicle affected by the hydraulic power steering system. Comparisons between measured data and simulation results validate the correctness of the model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the co-simulation method.

The proposed sliding mode observer provides very good performance for both low and high speed motor operation. Furthermore, the proposed system is robust in motor losses and load variations. The proposed observer does not uses complicated observer gains and it is easy to setup for different types of motor. The convergence of the proposed observer is obtained using the Lyapunov theory.

One solution that is both reliable and very cheap is assured by one upgrade of the information system using local elements based on the Intel 80C852 microcontroller. This solution realizes correction of the errors during local data acquisition and cancellation of data transmission errors in the technological process. Also, intelligent elements built with the Intel 80C852 microcontroller were added to the functional adjustments to realize monitoring of the environmental conditions and of the statistical data picked up during the working period of the final products.

The main focus is on generating realistic test stimuli, enabling interactivity between test driver and test object, and facilitating the process of designing a suitable fitness function. This is accomplished by integrating EFT with model-based testing methodologies resulting in an intuitive testing approach that enables even testers not familiar with search based testing to achieve good results with limited effort. A test environment optimized for deployment in the industrial domain is introduced. Features of the test environment include the capability of automatically generating realistic continuous test data sets, interacting with the system under test during test execution, and automatically executing and evaluating large numbers of tests.

Due to the prohibitive cost of deploying and implementing such a system in real world, most research in VANET relies on simulations for evaluation. A key component for VANET simulations is a realistic vehicular mobility model that ensures conclusions drawn from simulation experiments will carry through to real deployments. In this work, we introduce a tool MOVE that allows users to rapidly generate realistic mobility models for VANET simulations. MOVE is built on top of an open source micro-traffic simulator SUMO. The output of MOVE is a realistic mobility model and can be immediately used by popular network simulators such as ns-2 and qualnet. We evaluate and compare ad-hoc routing performance for vehicular nodes using MOVE to that using the random waypoint model. We show that the simulation results obtained when nodes moving according to a realistic mobility model is significantly different from that of the commonly used random waypoint model.","1525-3511","1-4244-0658-7","1-4244-0659-5","10.1109/WCNC.2007.467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4224712","","Ad hoc networks;Australia;Automotive engineering;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Roads;Testing;Transportation;Turning;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;public domain software;telecommunication network routing;traffic engineering computing","MOVE tool;SUMO;VANET simulations;ad-hoc routing performance;mobile nodes;network simulators;open source microtraffic simulator;random waypoint model;realistic vehicular mobility model;vehicular ad-hoc network;vehicular nodes","","","","60","","17","","","20070604","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This type of work is typically performed in the laboratory, i.e. on the desk. Second, the implementation of a prototype system, realized by (semi)automatic code generation and followed by a test with a “Lab-car” or in a real vehicle. The third and final step comprises the calibration and fine-tuning of algorithms and their parameters, commonly done in a real car. However, there are some flaws associated with this approach. There is no support for multiple interconnected electronic control units. Automatic generation of code of production quality is still a challenging task. And there is a large gap between the properties of a virtual car and the behavior of the real vehicle. The latter is one reason why nowadays the adjustment of calibration parameters still needs to be done manually. In the future, the picture outlined above will change remarkably. Function development tools will be able to generate efficient and reliable software code automatically. Vehicle models will mimic the characteristics of the real object to an extent we cannot imagine today. And automated test without manual interference will unprecedented degree of optimization and quality throughout a complex network of electronic control units.

For the intraagent perspective, we consider a game-theoretic foundation, looking at agents as ""strategies,"" which encompasses the popular ""state-based"" paradigm. Three classes of relationships between models are studied: scenario checking (called eLSC checking), synthesis, and verification. We set a formally defined theoretical stage that allows us to express these three problems very simply, to discuss their complexity, and to describe optimal solutions. Our study reveals the intrinsic high computational difficulty of these tasks. Consequently, many related problems and solutions are surveyed, some of which can be the basis for practical solutions.

This paper is concentrated on the models that describe hybridized HMMWV vehicles and the simulation results or those models. Parallel and series configurations have been modeled using the advanced vehicle simulator (ADVISOR) software developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Both a retrofit approach and a constant power approach have been tested and the results are compared to the conventional model results. In addition, the effects of using smaller engines than the existing ones in hybrid HMMWV drive trains have been studied and the results are compared to the data collected from an actual implementation or such a vehicle.

IVHM should not be treated as a standalone subsystem, added on to the vehicle. Nor should a group of sensors and related instrumentation system be considered IVHM. From a software perspective, IVHM is more than just fault models, algorithms and sensor processing software. While IVHM utilizes these components to perform its intended function, a true IVHM system incorporates a philosophy, methodology and process that focuses on design and development for safety, operability, maintainability, reliability and testability. To be most effective, IVHM must be ""designed in"" to the target system (i.e., the vehicle and its supporting infrastructure) from the beginning of the program, and not ""added on"" along the way. IVHM principles must permeate the culture and mindset of the organization, being held in similar regard to safety. IVHM must be elevated to the status of a system engineering discipline. To do so requires a conscious effort be made by all those involved in the program.","","0-7803-9307-4","","10.1109/DASC.2005.1563450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563450","","Automotive engineering;Engineering management;Instruments;Maintenance;Performance evaluation;Safety;Sensor systems;Software algorithms;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","air safety;design for testability;reliability","integrated vehicle health management;maintainability;operability;reliability;safety;system engineering;testability","","","","4","","3","","","20051227","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is even more true for wireless sensor networks, since their nodes often provide very rudimentary debugging facilities, and sufficiently large networks for realistic analysis may be expensive to deploy. While this approach, also known as model-based design, is becoming quite standard for several domains that have similar constraints as wireless sensor networks, such as automotive electronics, there is a lack of tools for this purpose in the WSN world. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we present a framework (based on Simulink, Stateflow and Embedded Coder) in which an engineer can create sensor network components (both at the application and at the protocol level) that can be used as building blocks to model, simulate and automatically generate code for different underlying platforms and operating systems.","","978-1-4244-1777-3","978-1-4244-1776-6","10.1109/SAHCN.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557791","","Application software;Automotive electronics;Automotive engineering;Debugging;Light emitting diodes;Microelectronics;Operating systems;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Wireless sensor networks","codes;wireless sensor networks","automatic code generation;automotive electronics;model-based design;sensor network applications;wireless sensor networks","","","","6","","22","","","20080709","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, on the physical side of cyber-physical systems we will have to contend with not only real time requirements but also the continuous and continual nature of the system. This poses a new set of challenges for requirements engineering; we must write well defined requirements to address crucial issues not commonly addressed in the software domain. For example, the rate of change of a controlled variable, the time it takes for a controlled variable to settle sufficiently close to a set-point, and the cumulative errors built up over time may be of critical importance. In this paper we outline how early modeling in the continuous domain serves as a crucial aid in the elicitation and discovery of requirements for cyber-physical systems and provide an initial classification of the types of requirements needed to describe crucial aspects of the physical side of a cyber-physical system.","","","","10.1109/TwinPeaks.2013.6614716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614716","Requirements;cyber-physical systems;modeling","Accuracy;Automotive engineering;Biological system modeling;Control systems;Drugs;Software;Vehicles","pattern classification;systems analysis;ubiquitous computing","continual domain;continuous domain;cumulative errors;cyber-physical systems;physical side;requirement type classification;set-point;software domain","","","","0","","10","","","20130930","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

SLD means many things to different people since there is no wide agreement on a definition of the term. Academia, designers, and EDA experts have taken different avenues to attack the problem, for the most part springing from the basis of traditional EDA and trying to raise the level of abstraction at which integrated circuit designs are captured, analyzed, and synthesized from. However, my opinion is that this is just the tip of the iceberg of a much bigger problem that is common to all system industry. In particular, I believe that notwithstanding the obvious differences in the vertical industrial segments (for example, consumer, automotive, computing, and communication), there is a common underlying basis that can be explored. This basis may yield a novel EDA industry and even a novel engineering field that could bring substantial productivity gains not only to the semiconductor industry but to all system industries including industrial and automotive, communication and computing, avionics and building automation, space and agriculture, and health and security, in short, a real technical renaissance. In this paper, I present the challenges faced by industry in system level design. Then, I propose a design methodology, platform-based design (PBD), that has the potential of addressing these challenges in a unified way.

During the calculation of heat radiation intensity across the mould surface, we will use experimental measured values for the heat radiation intensity from a sensor in proximity to an infrared heater. It is necessary to maintain approximately the same heat radiation intensity across the whole mould surface during warming process. The model described in this article allows us to optimize the infrared heaters' location for this purpose. In this way, we obtain the same material structure and color tone across the whole surface of an artificial leather. We will apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the heaters' location.

This paper describes a contribution to the transformation of AADL models. In this paper we present an approach for transforming AADL model into prototype verification system (PVS) specification and deductive verification of such AADL models using the PVS interactive theorem prover. Our transformation includes two aspects: structure and behavior description. Applying a PVS specification of a AADL language semantics, we generate a formal representation of the AADL model. After the transformation, some properties, such as safety and reliability, of the model build by AADL could be verified using PVS. We use an example to demonstrate the correctness and feasibility of our approach. Then, we verified the safety and reliability attributes of dependability in our model.

To overcome the shortcomings of the existing models based on the modified Reynolds equation (MRE), the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a natural choice in modeling high Knudsen number (Kn) flows owing to its advantages over conventional methods. The transient and parallel nature makes this LBM an attractive tool for the next generation air bearing design. Although LBM has been successfully applied to single component systems, a multicomponent system analysis has been thwarted because of the complexity in coupling the terms for each component. Previous studies have shown good results in modeling immiscible component mixtures by use of an interparticle potential. In this paper, we extend our LBM model to predict the flow rate of high Kn pressure-driven flows in multicomponent gas mixture air bearings, such as the air–helium system. For accurate modeling of slip conditions near the wall, we adopt our LBM scheme with spatially dependent relaxation times for air bearings in HDIs. To verify the accuracy of our code, we tested our scheme via simple two-dimensional benchmark flows. In the pressure-driven flow of an air–helium mixture, we found that the simple linear combination of pure helium and pure air flow rates, based on helium and air mole fraction, gives considerable error when compared to our LBM calculation. Hybridization with the existing MRE database can be adopted with the procedure reported here to develop the state-of-the-art slider design software.","0021-8979","","","10.1063/1.3564945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5749251","","","Knudsen flow;air;gas mixtures;helium;lattice Boltzmann methods;slip flow;two-phase flow","","","4711Qr;4745Gx;4755-t","","1","","","","","20110411","","AIP","","AIP Journals & Magazines"

In order to make delta-oriented testing strategies applicable in this context, we transfer them to the requirements level and show how a delta-oriented classification of requirements and associated test cases reduce test effort in these less formal domains.","","","","10.1109/PLEASE.2013.6608665","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6608665","Delta Modeling;Incremental Testing;Software Product Lines","Conferences;Natural languages;Presses;Software;Software engineering;Testing;Vehicles","natural languages;program testing;quality assurance;software quality","conceptual ideas;executable system specifications;formal domains;incremental model-based testing strategies;modern software systems;natural language;quality assurance strategies;requirements-based delta-oriented SPL testing;software product lines testing","","","","0","","16","","","20130926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, the use of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) introduces uncertainties in measured signals due to sampling and quantization effects. These imprecisions can have a significant effect on the tracking performance of the controller, to the point that it no longer meets the desired targets. This leads to costly design and verification iterations. In this paper, a generic methodology for modeling the uncertainty introduced by sampling and quantization is developed. The resulting values are then propagated through the system's state equations to determine the overall uncertainty bounds on the system model. This methodology is illustrated on the cold-start emission control problem. Verification is performed to ensure that the bounds have been accurately estimated. Finally, a sliding mode controller developed for the cold-start phase of an engine is modified to incorporate these bounds. Simulation on a real engine control unit (ECU) verifies the modified controller is more robust to implementation imprecision.","0743-1619","978-1-4799-0177-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6580267","","Engines;Equations;Fuels;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty;Quantization (signal);Uncertainty","analogue-digital conversion;automobiles;control system synthesis;internal combustion engines;sampling methods;variable structure systems","ADC;ECU;analog-to-digital converter;automotive control design;cold-start emission control problem;control software;engine control unit;implementation imprecision;physical systems;quantization effects;sampling effects;sliding mode controller;state equations","","","","0","","15","","","20130815","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The characteristics of any vehicle show a great variation in terms of the vehicle itself, its weight, engine, transmission and so on, as well as external disturbances caused by road incline, weather and the like. For optimal control of this control object with such continually changing characteristics, we used an adaptive control in the form of a self-tuning regulator. This self-tuning regulator consists of a dynamic characteristics estimator using a recursive least-squares nethod with vector-type forgetting factor, and a feedback gain calculator using a pole assignment. The problems involved in dynamic characteristics estimation are discussed and a procedure to solve them is proposed. Generally, in the estimation of dynamic characteristics, the static characteristic is a given, and the data from one operating point on the static characteristic are used for the estimation. However, in the case of the control object under study here, the operating point will change under external disturbances, and these changes cannot be measured. Therefore, since the estimation of the dynamic characteristics in this case does not fulfill the above conditions, the estimation procedure is extremely difficult. Thus, in the present study, the estimation of a vehicle model with a cruise control is shown as one approach to the estimation of the dynamic characteristics of the control object in which the operating point changes.","","0-87942-565-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4791762","","Adaptive control;Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Estimation error;Feedback;Optimal control;Road vehicles;Servomechanisms;Vehicle dynamics","","","","","","0","","3","","","20090310","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has led to tremendous research interest in techniques for scheduling signals, which are generated by real-time applications, on the FlexRay bus. Signals are first packed together into frames at the application-level and the frames are then transmitted over the bus. To ensure reliability of frames in the presence of faults, frames must be retransmitted over the bus but this comes at the cost of higher bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel frame packing method for FlexRay bus. Our method computes the required number of retransmissions of frames that ensures the specified reliability goal. The proposed frame packing method also ensures that none of the signals violates its deadline and that the desired reliability goal for guaranteeing fault-tolerance is met at the minimum bandwidth cost. Extensive experiments on synthetic as well as a industrial case study demonstrate the benefits of our method.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064524","FlexRay;Frame packing;Reliability;Scheduling","Bandwidth;Equations;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Mathematical model;Nickel","automotive engineering;fault tolerance;field buses;protocols;reliability;scheduling;vehicles","FlexRay bus;automotive networks;automotive vehicles;fault-tolerance;higher bandwidth utilization;next generation bus protocol;reliability-aware frame packing;scheduling signals;static segment","","","","0","","","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The more software components being included, the more effort on integration these components into one ECU has to be spend. Additionally, new standards like the ISO/DIS 26262 raise the requirements of testing safety critical components like an airbag-ECU due to functional safety. Trying to retain test coverage on rising functionality of new ECUs compared to older one will lead to longer test periods. The complexity of the integration phase will be intensified, if more then one supplier is integrating software into one ECU. In this paper we present our way to extend the scope of testing software of an ECU using the XCP in combination with an AUTOSAR compliant software basis. This enables flexible instrumentation and testing of an ECU during the whole process from software development at the beginning to acceptance testing at the end. The provided techniques help to simplify instrumenting an ECU for debugging and testing purposes during the whole lifetime. The on-the-fly configuration of XCP is additionally reducing the overhead of preparing an ECU to special test-cases and thus saving valuable time.","","978-1-4577-2058-1","","10.1109/ICCAIE.2011.6162106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162106","AUTOSAR;XCP;acceptance test;analysis;automotive application;component integration;debug interface;embedded systems;measurement;real-time;software development","Computer architecture;Data acquisition;Safety;Software;Testing;Timing;Unified modeling language","automatic test software;automotive components;automotive electronics;computerised instrumentation;integrated software;open systems;program debugging;program testing;safety-critical software;software architecture;software packages","AUTOSAR;XCP;airbag;automotive ECU;automotive open system architecture;compliant software;debugging;electronic control units;flexible instrumentation;flexible integration testing;functional safety;safety critical components;software components;software development;software testing","","","","0","","16","","","20120301","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have details in code files, low-level diagrams of software details (for example, class inheritance hierarchies), and system views of hardware environments, but these are not enough. We suggest that model of whole systems that we can diagram and hold in the mind's eye are so important for human understanding of complex systems of all kinds that, if they do not exist, they must be invented.

These characteristics are desirable in an micro underwater vehicle. Biologists have recently found that the boxfish's body shape generates self-correcting trimming forces by shedding counter rotating vortices to compensate for the instabilities in turbulent water. The purpose of this work is to study the effect of body shape on self-correcting vortex generation and use these results to design the outer body shape of a micro underwater vehicle mimicking a real boxfish. To this end, computer aided design and Engineering (CAD/CAE) tools such as solid modeling software and fluid flow simulation software were used for analysis and comparison of different body shapes. In this paper we present the numerical simulation results for two varieties of boxfish, namely the spotted boxfish the Buffalo trunkfish, and the results were used to derive key design guidelines for a suitable body shape that can exhibit the desired self-correcting mechanism.

Only a limited number of them can really be active permanently. The utility of the others depends on particular context scenarios. This motivates our goal of providing the car with the means necessary to dynamically adapt the set of active functions to its current requirements. Such a context-aware system has to construct a sound model of the actual context, based on available sources of information, such as sensors. In this paper, we present a generic context modeling approach suitable for dynamic configuration of automotive functions. The context model is divided into layers of different abstraction levels to enable the system to extract relevant context information. Data abstraction is accomplished by applying qualitative modeling techniques. The proposed method is sufficiently generic and enables an easy adjustment to specific system configurations and adaptation to new functions. The demonstration of the feasibility of the proposed solution and evaluation of its effectiveness was based on a simulated prototypical system configuration. Characteristics of ADAS functions were specified and their activation was measured during norm cycle test drives. The simulations yielded to a significant reduction in average function activity of an exemplary car system. Depending on the provided context parameters, a reduction of up to 24% was achieved.","","","","10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728336","","","","","","","","","","","","","20140130","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the automotive domain, AUTOSAR is an important standard to model components of electronic control units. AUTOSAR, however, lacks information about tests or test scenarios. Early testing in the automotive domain is often done by Model-in-the-Loop simulation. Simulations of several components are run in different environments, each. Thus, they need to be connected (co-simulated) for integration testing of these components, e.g., via simulator coupling. This paper is focused on closing the gap between AUTOSAR models and co-simulation-based test scenarios that use simulator coupling. Our main contribution is the definition of a modeling language to describe test environments. The instances of this language can be derived from existing AUTOSAR models and can also be used to automatically generate co-simulation-based test environments. Furthermore, we provide a workflow to integrate this model in the engineering process and an experiment report to demonstrate the applicability and the advantages of the approach.","","978-1-4577-1906-6","","10.1109/ICST.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200149","AUTOSAR;model in the loop;model-based testing;test","Adaptation models;Automotive engineering;Connectors;Couplings;Data models;Software;Testing","automotive components;automotive electronics;control engineering computing;digital simulation;open systems;program testing;software architecture","AUTOSAR models;MiL-testing;automotive domain testing;co-simulation-based test environments;co-simulation-based test scenarios;electronic control units;engineering process;integration testing;model components;model-in-the-loop simulation;modeling language;simulator coupling","","","","0","","24","","","20120517","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm takes into account the EGO-vehicle's driving state and the high-level representation of surrounding objects. Next the presented approach is evaluated from a real-time perspective by applying static code analysis to a reference implementation of the algorithm. The results suggest the application of further optimization techniques as the computational complexity does not allow an effective real-time behavior. In order to guarantee both real-time constraints and effective collision detection a novel method for the preselection of potential collision opponents based on the Random Forest classifier is employed.

The analysis of the dependability of such systems is a particularly complex task that mandates modeling capabilities in both the discrete and in the continuous domains. To tackle this problem a multi-level approach is presented here, which is based on abstract functional models to capture the behavior of the whole system, and on detailed structural models to cope with the details of system components. In this paper, we describe how the interaction between the two levels of abstraction is managed to provide accurate analysis of the dependability of the whole system. In particular, the proposed technique is shown to be able to identify faults affecting the CAN network whose effects are most likely to be critical for vehicle's dynamic. Exploiting the information about the effects of these faults, they can then be further analyzed at the higher level of details.","","1-58113-947-0","","10.1109/SBCCI.2004.241020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1360547","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Fault diagnosis;Information analysis;Permission;Protocols;Testing;Vehicle dynamics","automotive electronics;controller area networks;protocols;road safety;traffic engineering computing;vehicle dynamics","CAN protocol;automotive fields;complex tasks;dependability analysis;digital components;functional models;mechanical components;multilevel approach;networked systems;safety critical applications;vehicle dynamics","","","","0","","","","","20041130","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network tests and verification by means of behavioral simulations have been widely adopted by the O&Ms. Among a series of advantages, behavioral simulations allow the statistical analysis performance evaluation, which is important to assess the system reliability. Our objective is to perform the in-vehicle verification, including Monte Carlo analysis, using the developed VHDL-AMS behavioral models. With this objective, we have developed the implementation of the Monte Carlo analysis through VHDL-AMS functions. The main advantage of this approach is the feature portability since it allows statistical simulation in any VHDL-AMS simulator (even if the simulator do not support statistical analysis). This paper presents the Monte Carlo implementation and reports results of the feature applied to a Flexray in-vehicle communication network. This work is part of a research activity in the field of mixed-mode behavioral models applied to the test and verification of in-vehicle communication networks.","","978-1-4244-7905-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587133","","Analytical models;Communication networks;Driver circuits;Integrated circuit modeling;Monte Carlo methods;Transceivers","Monte Carlo methods;automotive electronics;hardware description languages;mobile communication;mobile computing;performance evaluation;safety-critical software;statistical analysis;vehicles","Flexray in-vehicle communication network;Monte Carlo analysis;Monte Carlo implementation;O&M;VHDL-AMS behavioral models;VHDL-AMS simulator;behavioral simulations;in-vehicle communication network statistical analysis;in-vehicle communication networks;in-vehicle verification;mixed-mode behavioral models;network tests;network verification;safety-critical system;statistical analysis performance evaluation;statistical simulation;system reliability","","","","1","","10","","","20100927","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

SmartC is a hierarchical modeling language and implements the SmartOSEK operating system model. The SmartC models are classified into four levels, namely module level, task level, subtask level and component level. In the SmartC models, control-flow oriented models and data-flow oriented models are integrated in the hybrid SmartC models. At the task level, the model is constructed based on the control flow, whereas the component level model is constructed based on the data flow. In SmartC programs, all inter-task communication, task triggering mechanisms, and access to guarded global variables, are automatically generated by the SmartC generator which generates the C code from the SmartC code. Having well-structured concurrency mechanisms, SmartC greatly reduces the risk of concurrency errors, such as deadlock and race conditions. The SmartC language is implemented on the automated manual transmission (AMT) control system and is compatible with the OSEK/VDX specifications.

Major reasons include: (1) the need for quality assurance for increasingly complex systems, (2) the emerging model-centric development paradigm, e.g., UML and MDA, with its seemingly direct connection to testing, and (3) the advent of test-centered development methodologies. Model-based testing relies on execution traces of behavior models. They are used as test cases for an implementation: input and expected output. This complements the ideas of model-driven testing. The latter uses static models to derive test drivers to automate test execution. This assumes the existence of test cases, and is, like the particular intricacies of OO testing, not in the focus of this tutorial. We cover major methodological and technological issues: the business case of model-based testing within model-based development, the need for abstraction and inverse concretization, test selection, and test case generation. We (1) discuss different scenarios of model-based testing, (2) present common abstractions when building models, and their consequences for testing, (3) explain how to use functional, structural, and stochastic test selection criteria, and (4) describe today's test generation technology. We provide both practical guidance and a discussion of the state-of-the-art.

Although advanced solutions for heat removal like Isolated Metal Substrates (IMS) base materials or thermally conductive epoxies have entered the market for a few years they still have a high price tag and add significant manufacturing costs to the finished assembly. Obtaining a good thermal management by using conventional materials and manufacturing techniques is often a key design challenge that engineers have to overcome. By creating thermal paths from one layer to another, the equivalent cooling area for an electronic component can be significantly increased thus lowering the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance which is the main indicator of cooling performance. These thermal paths between layers are commonly defined as through-hole plated vias connected to copper areas. Our paper presents a study of the thermal performances of through-hole thermal vias used for heat transfer between layers on printed circuit boards.

The purposes of the shock absorber are to dissipate the energy accumulated by the suspension spring displacement, controlling thus the vertical motion between vehicle body and tires. The shock absorber has great influence on both ride and handling performance of vehicles, and a great many previous researches have been done on modeling and simulation of the shock absorber, the models and parameters presented in those researches are always based on drawings, observations, measurements, experiences, and so on. However, because of the human mistakes and errors in the manufacture, and a lack of information, certain information and precise values do not exist, uncertainty may result. Actually, the uncertainty may have great influence on the shock absorber, so it is necessary to investigate the influence of the uncertainties on the performance of the shock absorber. In this paper, a detailed twin tube shock absorber model was established using Dymola/modelica software. This model contains the piston valve assembly, base valve assembly, rebound chamber, compression chamber, reserve chamber and so on. Then a fuzzy algorithm, which is based on fuzzy set theory, is presented to analyze the response of the shock absorber with uncertain parameters. In this method, uncertain parameters such as the friction between the piston and the chamber, the dimension of the valve disc, the stiffness of the spring, etc., are described mathematically as fuzzy variables and integrated into shock absorber analysis. The simulations are carried out to analyze the performance of the shock absorber with uncertain parameters. The results demonstrate the method is effective to model systems with uncertain parameters.","","978-1-4244-7235-2","978-1-4244-7237-6","10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5619120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5619120","Dymola/Modelica;fuzzy set theory;handling;ride;shock absorber;uncertainty","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Measurement uncertainty;Springs;Suspensions","automotive components;fuzzy set theory;mechanical engineering computing;modelling;pistons;shock absorbers;simulation;springs (mechanical);tyres;valves","Dymola/modelica software;base valve assembly;compression chamber;fuzzy uncertain parameters;modeling;piston valve assembly;rebound chamber;reserve chamber;shock absorber;simulation;suspension spring displacement;tires;vehicle;vertical motion","","","","0","","10","","","20101104","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a combination of both model based design techniques and requirements management methodologies, a new kind of requirements engineering methodology has been established. However, due to the complexity of this methodology and the high degree of informal aspects a unique and integrated methodology for requirements engineering is still needed.

International norms like ISO 26262 and IEC 61165 postulate methods for the development and verification of safety critical systems. These standards should ensure that the dependability and quality of the embedded systems is maintained while their complexity and interdependence increases. Yet, the standards do not contain concrete methods or tools for their fulfillment. As concerns classic techniques for dependability analysis they either base on system analysis by means of Markov analysis or on reliability estimation from a usage perspective. Treating the system only from one perspective, however, is a drawback as the system analysis neglects functional or non-functional dependences of the system. These dependences can directly influence the reliability in the field usage. In this paper we present our approach to combine component dependency models with usage models to overcome these deficiencies. It is possible to identify usage scenarios which aim for critical dependences and to analyze the interaction of components inside the system. On the other hand usage scenarios can be assessed whether they meet the desired verification purpose. The component dependency models reveal dependences that were not identified before, because it allows the extraction of implications across functional and non functional dependences like memory, timing and processor utilization.","","978-1-61284-818-1","978-1-61284-819-8","10.1109/SIES.2011.5953678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953678","Automated Testing;Dependability;Fault Tolerance;Road Vehicles;Safety Critical Systems;Software Testing;System Design;Validation;Verification","Reliability;Safety;Software;Testing;Timing;Unified modeling language","IEC standards;ISO standards;Markov processes;automotive engineering;embedded systems;formal verification;road safety;safety-critical software","IEC 61165 norm;ISO 26262 norm;Markov analysis;component dependency model;dependability analysis;embedded systems;memory utilization;model-based verification;processor utilization;reliability estimation;safety-critical systems;timing utilization;vehicle comfortability;vehicle efficiency;vehicle safety","","","","3","","17","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To optimize the coupling between simulation and the MC the different parts of the system have to be analyzed. A numerical analysis of the algorithms used by the programs, which are executed on the MC, can help to find optimized settings for the data exchange between simulation and MC. Numerical error analysis is very costly so our approach combines a precalculated analysis result database with graph matching and recombination of program graphs.

In this respect, two design approaches are generally opposed which respectively propose to define domain-specific modeling languages from scratch or to customize an existing general-purpose language. This paper focuses on the latter approach and claims that UML profiles do provide handy and powerful mechanisms to design domain-specific modeling languages but are penalized by lacks of methodological guidelines and tool support.

In this paper, we use computer modelling and measurements to demonstrate that radiation pattern diversity for the FM band at 100 MHz can be obtained by switching the load on a parasitic antenna placed in close vicinity of the feed antenna on an automobile. This configuration only requires one feed cable and a single amplifier. In addition, a pin diode controlled by a single wire is used to switch between loads on the parasitic antenna. This significantly reduces the cost of the system when compared to a 4 antenna diversity system and there is the potential that it can be used in small sized apertures. The simulations were verified by measurements on a real car or a scaled models whenever possible.

The paradigm of the IoS indeed offers interesting capabilities in terms of dynamicity and interoperability. However in domains that involve “things” (e.g. appliances), there is still a strong need for loose coupling and a proper separation between types and instances that are well-known in Component-Based approaches but that typical SOA fail to provide. This paper presents how we can still get the best of both worlds by augmenting SOA with a Component-Based approach.

In addition, in a model-based design flow, the results of the model validation and verification are retained only if the code implementation preserves the semantic properties of interest. Since AUTOSAR does not support the modeling of the internal behavior of runnables, the most likely candidate for the development of the functions behavior is Simulink, which is based on a Synchronous Reactive semantics. Commercial code generation tools offer solutions for preserving the signal flows exchanged among model blocks allocated to the same core, but do not scale to multicore systems. In this paper, we summarize the possible options for the implementation of communication mechanisms that preserve signal flows, and discuss the tradeoff in the implementation of AUTOSAR models on multicore platforms.","","978-1-61284-818-1","978-1-61284-819-8","10.1109/SIES.2011.5953656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953656","","Indexes;Multicore processing;Protocols;Semantics;Software;Synchronization;Unified modeling language","automotive engineering;data integrity;multiprocessing systems;software architecture","AUTOSAR software;Simulink;automotive open system architecture;concurrent task;data consistency;multicore system;signal flow preservation;synchronous reactive semantics","","","","2","","17","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model driven architecture is a design methodology addressing these emerging requirements. Developing embedded systems according to this model-based paradigm requires a platform-independent representation of the functionality of the application as well as a precise model of the targeted hardware platform. In this paper we introduce a meta-model for capturing the resources of hardware platforms realizing the DECOS architecture, which is an integrated time-triggered architecture aimed at the development of distributed embedded systems. Furthermore, we present a tool chain based on this meta-model that speeds up the modeling process and reduces the likelihood of human errors by facilitating the reuse of hardware building blocks from libraries","","0-7695-2561-X","","10.1109/ISORC.2006.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630462","","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Costs;Design methodology;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Humans;Libraries;Real time systems","embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;software reusability;systems analysis","DECOS integrated architecture;distributed embedded systems;hardware platforms;model driven architecture;software reuse;time-triggered architecture","","","","3","","","","","20060515","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a novel and practical approach for prioritizing requirements in software projects.

However, effects occurring e.g. on the physical level may impact the whole system and cannot be captured by using only high abstracted models. Co-simulation is a possible solution for this problem. It enables the combination of an abstracted, system level view with highly accurate models of different components, and thus supports the analysis and validation of the embedded system. In this work we present an approach based on the inter-language run-time switching of simulation models during co-simulation. This new method enables long-time system level simulation with dynamic (user defined) switches to more accurate models for the punctual analysis of low level effects.

Simulation plays a key role in the planning process of a new production line to determine if it can meet expected demand. However, these simulations can be very time consuming and can often take up to a day to execute a single run. This paper investigates how distributed simulation based on the IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture and the emerging standard COTS Simulation Package Interoperability Product Development Group (CSPI-PDG) Type I Interoperability Reference Model could be used to reduce the time taken for a single simulation run. CSP interoperability and the problem of integrating CSPs with HLA software (the runtime infrastructure) are presented. New prototype benchmarking software, the COTS Simulation Package Emulator (CSPE), which is being developed to investigate distributed simulation problems, is discussed. The paper then develops a case study of how this was used to investigate the feasibility of using distributed simulation at Ford. The paper discusses results obtained from this case study and suggests that distributed simulation could indeed be beneficial to Ford.","","0-7695-2462-1","","10.1109/DISTRA.2005.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530663","","Assembly;Computer architecture;Engines;Manufacturing processes;Meeting planning;Packaging;Process planning;Product development;Production planning;Standards development","IEEE standards;automobile industry;automotive engineering;digital simulation;distributed processing;open systems;process planning;production engineering computing;software packages","COTS simulation package emulator;COTS simulation package interoperability;CSP interoperability;Ford Motor Company;IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture;distributed simulation;engine production;interoperability reference model;product development group;production line;prototype benchmarking software","","","","4","","","","","20051114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Markets for electronic services have come into being. The by far most common market type is the open service market (OSM). Most approaches, e.g. trading, however, are dedicated to a single service use only. Therefore, we analysed the relationships between service customers and providers using transaction cost theory. We found that there is insufficient support for the repetitive use of services on a long-term basis. To bridge this gap, we developed the model of service supplier relations (SSR), drawing inspiration from the subcontracting industry, which is widely accepted, e.g. in the automotive industry. In the discussion of the SSR model, we concentrate on issues relating to the monitoring and enforcement of service supply agreements. In particular, we focus on the long-term aspects of such agreements and on quality of service (QoS). We apply a categorization of service properties into five groups of service aspects. For each of these groups, we explain how to manage them using QoS control loops. Finally, we also demonstrate how SSR and QoS control loops can be implemented","","0-7803-5158-4","","10.1109/EDOC.1998.723256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723256","","Automotive engineering;Bridges;Companies;Consumer electronics;Costs;Industrial relations;Monitoring;Quality of service;Subcontracting;Web and internet services","Internet;business communication;corporate modelling;open systems;outsourcing;quality of service;transaction processing","Internet;automotive industry;customer-provider relationships;electronic services;enterprise-level analysis;long-term aspects;open service market;repetitive service use;service properties categorization;service quality control loops;service quality enforcement;service supplier relations;service supply agreement monitoring;subcontracting industry;trading;transaction cost theory","","","","0","","13","","","20020806","03 Nov 1998-05 Nov 1998","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

SPL variants are configured by selecting feature sets that satisfy feature model constraints. Configuration of large feature models can involve multiple stages and participants, which makes it hard to avoid conflicts and errors. New techniques are therefore needed to debug invalid configurations and derive the minimal set of changes to fix flawed configurations. This paper provides three contributions to debugging feature model configurations: (1) we present a technique for transforming a flawed feature model configuration into a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and show how a constraint solver can derive the minimal set of feature selection changes to fix an invalid configuration, (2) we show how this diagnosis CSP can automatically resolve conflicts between configuration participant decisions, and (3) we present experiment results that evaluate our technique.

This module simulates the generation of snapshots by individual vehicles, the uploading of these snapshots to roadside units, and some probe vehicle data postprocessing. While some temporary simplifying assumptions are made, the simulation generally follows operational concepts described in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2735 Surface Vehicle Standard. Application of the model is demonstrated by simulating IntelliDrive probe data collection over the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)'s Michigan Proof-of-Concept testbed. Simulation results show the sensitivity of probe data collection to communication range, market penetration, number of active roadside communication units (RSEs), interval between snapshots, and snapshot buffer size. Impacts on link travel time estimates are also presented. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of the simulator in conducting evaluations and sensitivity analyses for scenarios that would be difficult to execute in existing testbeds.","1524-9050","","","10.1109/TITS.2009.2034017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299082","Data acquisition;simulation and modeling of transportation systems;traffic probe vehicles;vehicle–infrastructure integration (VII) systems;virtual testbed;wireless communication","Application software;Automotive engineering;Microscopy;Probes;Road vehicles;System testing;Traffic control;Transportation;Vehicle safety;Wireless communication","application program interfaces;traffic engineering computing","IntelliDrive systems;J2735 surface vehicle standard;Society of Automotive Engineers;application programming interface;paramics microscopic traffic simulation;probe vehicle data assessment;proof-of-concept testbed;roadside communication units;virtual testbed","","","","9","","21","","2009-10-30","20110829","","IEEE","IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to obtain the vibration characteristics and vibration frequency distributions, structural characteristics of the connecting rod mechanism using modal analysis is investigated. Firstly, a physical model of connecting rod mechanism is built using CAD software. Secondly finite element analysis and simulation of the model is taken by Hyperworks and MSC. Nastran softwares. Then its flexible multi-body dynamic model is established by ADAMS/View. And the fatigue stress of connecting rod under the max combustion pressure and Inertia force condition is calculated using the durability Module. The result indicates the stress distribution and deformation instance. The stress is mainly produced on the joint of connecting rod shell and the bottom end or the top end. And the biggest stress acting on the connecting rod is just 34.0613 MPa, early smaller than its limited stress 355 MPa. The method provides the theoretical evidence for connecting rod structure improvement and optimum design.","","978-1-4244-5001-5","978-1-4244-5739-7","10.1109/ICMTMA.2010.543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459521","ADAMS;connecting rod;finite element analysis","Analytical models;Boundary conditions;Combustion;Diesel engines;Fatigue;Finite element methods;Frequency;Joining processes;Modal analysis;Stress","CAD;automotive engineering;diesel engines;finite element analysis;modal analysis;vibration measurement","CAD software;Hyperworks software;MSC Nastran software;connecting rod mechanism;deformation instance;diesel engine;durability Module;fatigue stress;finite element analysis;inertia force condition;max combustion pressure;modal analysis;multibody dynamic model;stress distribution;vibration characteristic;vibration frequency distribution","","","","0","","3","","","20100506","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We automated the method by integrating it in our tools Compaan/Laura. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated by an implementation of a real-world application taken from the automotive domain.","","0-7695-2445-1","","10.1109/FCCM.2005.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1508545","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer science;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Image edge detection;Image resolution;Motion detection;Signal processing;Target tracking","embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;program compilers","Compaan;FPGA implementation;Laura;parameterized Kahn process networks;program decomposition","","","","3","","21","","","20051017","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, important design decisions have to be made at early design stages when some performance parameters of new sub-systems may not be validated yet. To account for uncertainty in the system development we use statistical modeling and discrete event simulation to perform sensitivity analysis from an average-case perspective. Average-case analysis is useful if performance aspects during normal system operation are of interest. The simulation model we implemented enables us to conduct holistic sensitivity analyses of systems consisting of multiple controllers, field-busses, sensors, actors, and applications. Applications are modeled as signal chains traversing the system model experiencing delay in each node along the predefined path. We present the strength of our approach by analyzing the latency of a distributed application in case of an asynchronous, synchronous, and event-triggered integrated ECU context. The results show that clock drift may result in high signal latencies in asynchronous ECUs and synchronous ECUs are superior in terms of signal latency and jitter. Event-triggered ECUs have to be designed carefully and come with trade-offs between performance of the legacy system and new applications.","","978-1-4244-5882-0","","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482497","","","automotive electronics;discrete event simulation;embedded systems;integrated circuit design;sensitivity analysis;software maintenance;statistical analysis;timing;timing jitter;traffic engineering computing","asynchronous integrated ECU;automotive embedded systems;average case analysis;clock drift;discrete event simulation;event triggered integrated ECU;high signal latencies;integrated electronic control unit design;legacy sub-systems;sensitivity analysis;signal jitter;statistical modeling;synchronous integrated ECU;timing problems","","","","1","","12","","","20100607","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

By decoupling the modeling of services from their implementation on target component configurations this process enables exploration of multiple architectures implementing the same set of services.

In order to minimize fuel consumption when driving at high speeds, it is necessary to control the relative vehicle speed against the wind. This paper proposes a new type of speedometer that is based on wind speed instead of conventional ground speed. For the detection of wind speed, we focus on the whistle principle where the frequency of the whistle sound is proportional to the airflow rate. To measure the wind speed as airflow rate, we developed a special whistle suitable for a wind-based vehicle speedometer by using CAD software for three-dimensional modeling. Characteristics of the developed wind-based vehicle speedometer were tested in both indoor experiments and actual-vehicle outdoor experiments. The validity of the proposed method was confirmed by the experiments.","","978-4-907764-34-0","978-4-907764-33-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334796","CAD;speedometer;vehicle;whistle","Automotive engineering;Frequency measurement;Fuels;Intelligent vehicles;Prototypes;Software prototyping;Vehicle driving;Velocity measurement;Vibration measurement;Wind speed","CAD;computerised instrumentation;fuel economy;road vehicles;sensors;solid modelling;velocity measurement;wind power","3D modeling;CAD software;actual-vehicle outdoor experiment;airflow rate;experimental study;fuel consumption minimization;indoor experiment;road vehicle driving direction;sensor;vehicle speed control;whistle sound principle;wind speed detection;wind-based vehicle speedometer","","","","0","","5","","","20091113","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Starting with a variants system specification including a set of task graphs, linear constraints on binary variables are specified for their alternative selection as well as the selection of groups of alternatives called application groups. These constraints may stem from a certain domain knowledge, e. g., entertainment or power train domain, or global constraints. The typically vast space of resulting possible combinations of different selections of alternative behaviors will be termed variant space and those satisfying the set of formulated constraints valid variants. An important result of this paper is that the set of variants, and especially the set of valid variants, do not need to be modeled or stored explicitly but rather implicitly. Nevertheless do we show that using state-of-the-art PB solver techniques, we may determine the set of valid variants very efficiently. Each of these valid variants may subsequently be used as a candidate for design space exploration (DSE) in order to optimize also the mapping of the corresponding task graph functionalities to a final optimized E/E architecture.

Restricting the computational model to purely time-triggered task activation and applying application specific constraints enables us to perform exact response time analyses without pessimism. The analysis can be done efficiently since our computational model drastically limits the number of critical instant candidates to be considered for the worst-case scenario. Simulation results show that the original computational model incorporates a significant amount of response time overestimation and a high computational workload. The presented method can be applied in early design stages as well as in series development and helps to reduce development risks for electronic control units and embedded telematic systems.","1090-3038","978-1-4244-3573-9","978-1-4244-3574-6","10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5594406","","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Clocks;Computational modeling;Context;Real time systems;Time factors","automotive electronics;computational complexity;embedded systems;scheduling;software maintenance","asynchronous real-time systems;automotive context;electronic control units;embedded telematic systems;formal schedulability analysis;intelligent safety applications;purely time-triggered task activation;schedulability analysis;task timing validation;time-triggered automotive real-time systems;time-triggered communication","","","","0","","13","","","20101004","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of a coherent multi-dimensional model across all development phases enables model-based design to generate systems that are correct by construction. Even some commercial support is available for code generation from higher-level models. However, such code generation capabilities are usually limited to uniprocessor targets and to a limited range of operating environments. SysWeaver (previously called Time Weaver) is a model-based development tool that includes a flexible syscode generation scheme for distributed real-time systems that can be easily tailored to a wide range of target platforms. In this paper, we present our work on creating an interoperable toolchain to automatically generate complete runtime code using models. The toolchain includes a simulation tool (Matlab) and its code generator (Embedded Coder) along with SysWeaver. In this chain, the functional aspects of the system are specified in Simulink, Matlabs modeling language, and translated into a SysWeaver model to be enhanced with timing information, the target hardware model and its communication dependencies. The final runtime code is then generated, automatically integrating the functional code generated with Embedded Coder and SysWeavers syscode. This syscode includes OS interfacing and network communication code with predictable timing behavior that can be verified at design time. Experiments with multi-node targets with end-to-end timing constraints in an automotive system show that many aspects of syscode and functional code generation can be automated. To our knowledge, this is the first time that multi-node executables including communication messages, functional behaviors and para-functional properties have been automatically generated using a general platform-independent framework.","1545-3421","0-7695-2516-4","","10.1109/RTAS.2006.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613339","","Application software;Computer languages;Embedded system;Hardware;Mathematical model;Multimedia systems;Real time systems;Runtime;System testing;Timing","","","","","","14","","14","","","20060424","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many cases, however, the control problem is formulated under platoon configuration and for some predictable noncollision situations. For predictable collision situations, regional and hierarchical approaches have been employed, but these approaches render difficulties due to ignorance for modeling error and logical error in a decision process. In this paper, the vehicle control for collision avoidance is studied with two control objectives, i.e., minimization of the safety distance error and regulation of the relative velocity between two vehicles. For this, a longitudinal controller using terminal sliding mode (TSM) with hierarchical structure is proposed for rear-end collision avoidance. The TSM is employed to achieve convergence in finite time, while the hierarchical approach is used for the system to accommodate the intelligence of the driver to handle various situations.

Movement of vehicle v on object o is atomic, i.e. v can either pass o or not. The atomic movement of v on o is decomposed into a sequence of atomic movements on the lower-level objects of o. Thus, the vehicle movement is modeled as a nested transaction which holds objects in the space tree.

It uses sets of integration constraints that link (families of) system features in one view to other (families of) features in the same or a different view. Both, families and constraints, are formalised using a feature algebra. Besides presenting a constraint relation and its mathematical properties, the paper shows in several examples the suitability of this approach for a wide class of integration constraint formulations.","","978-0-7695-3437-4","","10.1109/SEFM.2008.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685796","algebra;multiviews;requirements;specification;view reconciliation","Algebra;Automotive engineering;Concrete;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Production;Programming;Software engineering;Software systems","algebraic specification;embedded systems","algebraic view reconciliation;automotive systems;embedded systems","","","","1","","22","","","20081121","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results are obtained with CFD calculations, namely by STARCCM+ for an axisymmetric model, taking advantage of the symmetry of the problem, to minimize the computational time; in addition the HAHT is simulated with an actuator disk that gave reliable results in good agreement with previous works, developed with different software, and with experimental results. The original airfoil was designed for high-lift regimes, so it already gave excellent performance in these kind of applications.

Focusing on optimizing fuel economy of the vehicle, five main issues are studied in this paper. Firstly, based on the analyses of resistances for the STACV in a sandy loam working condition, a theoretical model for fuel consumption of 100 km, which is an evaluation index for fuel economy, is established. Secondly, through simplified by a group of constraint equations based on the physical structure of the vehicle, the running parameters and control target (fuel consumption of 100 km) could be expressed by the following two measurable and adjustable parameters, fan rotational speed and vehicle forward speed. Thirdly, a genetic algorithms (GA) model is designed to optimize the fuel consumption and to get the relevant parameters off line as control objectives of status variables of a control system. Fourthly, the control system with a fuzzy PID controller and a GA-based PID controller is built to achieve the minimal fuel consumption by regulating fan rotational speed and vehicle forward speed respectively. Fifthly, simulations are performed in a MATLAB/Simulink software environment. The result illustrates that this control system works efficiently and steadily.","","978-1-4244-1848-0","978-1-4244-1849-7","10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4677507","GA-based PID;fuel consumption of 100km;fuel economy;fuzzy PID;genetic algorithms;semi-track air-cushion vehicle","Control systems;Defense industry;Fuel economy;Fuzzy control;Genetic algorithms;Mathematical model;Petroleum;Propulsion;Three-term control;Vehicles","fuel economy;fuzzy control;genetic algorithms;three-term control;vehicles","air-cushion lifting system;fan rotational speed;fuel consumption;fuel economy optimization;fuzzy PID controller;fuzzy control;genetic algorithms;heavy-duty vehicles;semitrack air-cushion vehicle;semitrack propulsion system;vehicle forward speed","","","","0","","10","","","20081118","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This information, along with elevation data, infrared imagery, a vehicle mobility model and various metadata (local weather reports, Zobler Soil map, etc.), is fed into automated path planning software to provide a stand-alone ability to generate rapidly updateable dynamic mobility maps for Manned or Unmanned Ground Vehicles (MGVs or UGVs). These polygon based mobility maps can reside on an individual platform or a tactical network. When new information is available, change files are generated and ingested into existing mobility maps based on user selected criteria. Bandwidth concerns are mitigated by the use of shape files for the representation of the data (e.g. each object in the scene is represented by a shape file and thus can be transmitted individually). User input (desired level of stealth, required time of arrival, etc.) determines the priority in which objects are tagged for updates. This technology was tested at Fort Knox, Kentucky October 11th - 15th 2004. Satellite imagery was acquired in a near-real-time fashion for the selected test site. Portions of the resulting geo-rectified image were compared with surveyed range locations to assess the accuracy of the approach. The derived UGV Path Plans were ingested into a Stryker UGV and the routes were autonomously traversed.

The paper demonstrates how worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis is integrated into such a high-level application design and simulation tool MATLAB/Simulink-thus providing a higher-level interface to WCET analysis. The MATLAB/Simulink extensions compute and display worst-case timing data for all blocks of a MATLAB/Simulink simulation, which gives the developer of an application valuable feedback about the correct timing of the application being developed.

Components can contain variation points determining where components may vary. Associated variants define how this variability can be realized in different component configurations. We present a meta model for hierarchical variability modeling to formalize the conceptual ideas.

The main purpose of the automatic guidance system is to maintain the truck inline under the overhead power lines, allowing it to achieve higher speeds on grade. In an open pit mine with a trolley operation, this would be an added feature to the direct trolley and diesel boost application. The automatic guidance system would assist or completely relieve the driver when the truck is running on trolley, and hence, full utilization of the overhead trolley system would be achieved. The microcontroller-based guidance system measures simple quantities directly from the overhead power lines, and sends commands to guide the vehicle without the need for tracks or buried wires.

The general model is created in assembly and every part design is finished according to general assembly. The group of piston crankshaft connecting rod is designed and each part is modeled in Pro/E. Pro/E is a solid modeler and this offers considerable advantage for solid model creation. Normally, the geometry is first sketched in 2-D and then extruded in the third direction to generate a 3-D model. In Pro/E, it is important to first create the base geometry. The base geometry is that geometry that captures the design intent of the part to be modeled. This base geometry can be created using either the EXTRUDE or the REVOLVE options. Once this base geometry has been created, additional features like holes, rounds, chamfers, fillets, ribs, etc can be added in the finishing stages of the part creation. The center of the bowl does not coincide with the center of the cylinder due to the presence of valve pockets. The obvious advantage of this configuration is that is gives the true geometry of the piston and the presence of connecting rod means that the connecting rod ports can be accommodated when the piston is at the top dead center. In addition to the crankshaft with connecting rod, fly gear will also be added. Various instances of this configuration will then be created using the Â¿Family TableÂ¿ option of Pro/E wildfire in an attempt to optimize the engine performance. The presence of the connecting rod will make the mesh creation process more challenging for the modeler. This means that the numerical computation will be more intensive.","","978-1-4244-6388-6","978-1-4244-6389-3","10.1109/ETCS.2010.508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5458916","3-D model;Pro/E;Product families;Virtual Design;the top-down method","Assembly;Engine cylinders;Finishing;Gears;Geometry;Joining processes;Pistons;Ribs;Solid modeling;Valves","CAD/CAM;automotive engineering;computational geometry;engines;gears;pistons;rods (structures);shafts;solid modelling;valves","3-d design;PRO/E software;base geometry;engine performance;fly gear;mesh creation process;piston crankshaft connecting rod;solid model;top-down method;valve pockets","","","","1","","6","","","20100506","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The development of mobile telephones capable of handling data and the increased availability of wireless networks build up the second basis of mobile diagnosis. Using a suitable IT infrastructure, data can be obtained from the vehicle by every PC. In addition to the data channel, which allows precise vehicle identification and describes the condition of the vehicle, customer complaints can be dealt with over the voice channel and serve as a fundamental source of information. Vehicle data as well as the information from the driver are compared with previously occurred faults in other vehicles. Case based reasoning (CBR) systems applications are identified. The result is a precise ascertainment of the fault cause, from which the defective vehicle components can be determined.

To simplify the task, this paper presents an extendable Eclipse-based tool, called ArcheOpterix, which provides a framework to implement evaluation techniques and optimization heuristics for AADL specifications.

The adjusting of the ABS aims at getting the optimal sliding rate of the wheel and advancing braking performance. SIMULINK software is used to verify the effectiveness of the integrated controller in the normal driving condition and the braking condition. The simulation results show that when in normal driving condition, the Body Acceleration, the Suspension Working Space and the Dynamic Tyre Displacement were effectively inhibited, and the vehicle's ride and comfort were significantly improved; While in braking condition, the integrated controller can not only effectively prevent the wheel being locked, significantly shortening the braking distance and braking time, but also can improve the vehicle's comfort.

Also, test cases can be generated automatically with test sequence generation. For test automation of IVN of intelligent vehicle, several transition-based models and test suites which derived from practical test sequence generation strategy are developed. Also, test reports are generated automatically to analyze test results via IVN testing tool. To model the intelligent front lamp system, MATLAB/Simulink stateflow was used. Test sequence generation using TT (transition tour) can assure test coverage and reduce functional testing time. For actual IVN testing, Vector CANoe which supports IVN simulation and testing of actual bus was used.

The learning curve for mastering MAS model properties and problem's domain characterization is steep. The software engineers hesitate to use MAS since choosing a MAS-based methodology leads to fix the type of models that will be involved without inter-methodologies reusability. We think these are some of the reasons restricting the dissemination of multi-agent methods. This paper presents a self-organized MAS-based intelligent process to assist the engineer. This process comprises three stages: problem features and domain characterization, MAS components matching and meta-analysis. It aims to reduce the difficulties of starting an MAS-based solution to disseminate the use of MAS. The process is presented as a guiding tool for the engineers, especially for those less experienced in MAS, creating a path in the preliminary stage of the MAS conception. This approach is situated just before choosing a MAS framework or methodology to deploy a solution. We show how it works and we present a study case to compare our preliminary results.","","978-1-4244-8149-1","","10.1109/CERMA.2010.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5692336","Artificial Intelligence;Meta-analysis;Multi-agent systems;Software Engineering","Adaptation model;Context;Knowledge based systems;Probabilistic logic;Software;Software engineering;Text analysis","multi-agent systems;object-oriented programming;software agents;software engineering","METAOSE;agent oriented software engineering;meta-analysis;multi-agent systems","","","","0","","22","","","20110117","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The determination of the 3D model from multiple images is of key importance. One of the most important difficulties in autonomous 3D reconstruction is the (automatic) selection of the ""significant"" points which carry information about the shape of the 3D bodies i.e. are characteristic from the model point of view. Another problem to be solved is the point correspondence matching in different images. In this paper a 3D reconstruction technique is introduced, which is capable to determine the 3D model of a scene without any external (human) intervention. The method is based on recent results of image processing, epipolar geometry, and intelligent and soft techniques. Possible applications of the presented algorithm in vehicle system dynamics are also presented. The results can be applied advantageously at other engineering fields, like car-crash analysis, robot guiding, object recognition, supervision of 3D scenes, etc. as well.","","978-1-4244-1442-0","978-1-4244-1443-7","10.1109/SISY.2007.4342615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342615","3D reconstruction;car-body deformation modeling;crash analysis;epipolar geometry;features extraction;fuzzy image processing;image understanding;information enhancement;perspective geometry;point correspondence matching","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer vision;Image reconstruction;Intelligent vehicles;Layout;Mobile robots;Remotely operated vehicles;Shape;Vehicle dynamics","image matching;image reconstruction;vehicle dynamics","3D scene supervision;autonomous 3D model reconstruction;car-crash analysis;epipolar geometry;image processing;object recognition;point correspondence matching;robot guiding;vehicle system dynamics","","","","1","","19","","","20071008","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed controller is evaluated by simulations on two more complex vehicle models: a full-state vehicle model and a sedan model from commercial software Carsim.

In order to use a business document standard in a specific context, user groups define so-called implementation guidelines based on a subset consisting usually of 3 - 5% of the overall elements. When one defines a new implementation guideline for a specific context, one has always to start from scratch, which is time-consuming and also leads to heterogeneous interpretations of the standard. It is our goal to speed up the development process and to create more homogeneous implementation guidelines by learning from existing models. In the previous phases of our research we have developed the Enhanced Unified Context (E-UCM) model to represent business context. If we could assign instances of this model to already existing business document implementation guidelines, we may guess the subset of a new implementation guideline for a required BC. Accordingly, this paper describes our approach to calculate the content model (subset) of a message implementation guideline which is relevant in a required BC presented by the E-UCM context model.","","","","10.1109/INDIN.2013.6622939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6622939","","Automotive engineering;Business;Context;Context modeling;Guidelines;Industries;Standards","business data processing;document handling;message passing;ubiquitous computing","E-UCM context model;business context aware core component modeling;business context sensitive business documents;business document implementation guidelines;business document standards;enhanced unified context model;hierarchical structure;homogeneous implementation guidelines;message implementation guideline","","","","0","","","","","20131010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Verification of Replication Architectures in AADL","de Niz, D.; Feiler, P.H.","Software Eng.

This approach is known as replication. In spite of the number of studies on the topic, designing a replication pattern is still error prone. This is due to the fact that its final behavior is the result of the combination of design decisions that involves reasoning about a collection of non-deterministic events such as hardware failures and parallel computations. In this paper we present an approach to model replication patterns in the architecture analysis and design language (AADL) and analyze potentially unintended behaviors. Such an approach takes advantage of the strong semantics of AADL to model replication patterns at the architecture level. The approach involves developing two AADL models. The first one defines the intended behavior in synchronous call sequences. And the second model describes the replication architecture. These two models are then compared using a differential model in Alloy where the requirements of the first model and the concurrency and potential failure of the second are combined. The additional behaviors discovered in this model are presented to the designer as potential errors in the design. The designer then has the opportunity to modify the replication architecture to correct these behaviors or qualify them as valid behaviors. Finally, we validated our approach by recreating the verification experiment presented in but limiting ourselves to the AADL syntax.","","978-0-7695-3702-3","","10.1109/ICECCS.2009.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090549","AADL;Embedded;Model-Based Development;Model-Based Engineering;Real-Time;Replication;Verification","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Object oriented modeling;Pattern analysis;Runtime;Software engineering;USA Councils","formal verification;software architecture;software fault tolerance;specification languages","AADL;Alloy;architecture analysis and design language;differential model;fault tolerance;formal verification;replication architecture;synchronous call sequence","","","","0","","6","","","20090623","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dynamical systems are mathematical models describing how the state of a system evolves over time. They are important in modeling and understanding many applications, including embedded systems and cyber-physical systems. In discrete dynamical systems, the state evolves in discrete steps, one step at a time, as described by a difference equation or discrete state transition relation. In continuous dynamical systems, the state evolves continuously along a function, typically described by a differential equation. Hybrid dynamical systems or hybrid systems combine both discrete and continuous dynamics. This is a brief survey of differential dynamic logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems. We explain hybrid system models, differential dynamic logic, its semantics, and its axiomatization for proving logical formulas about hybrid systems. We study differential invariants, i.e., induction principles for differential equations. We briefly survey theoretical results, including soundness and completeness and deductive power.

The lack of composability and compositionality of traditional CAN leads to an overhead in the whole development cycle. In this paper we propose a development process that is based on a time-triggered CAN router. We examine the influence of our proposed development approach on major phases of the automotive V-Model.

However, providing a usable, customizable and performant instrumentation for AUTOSAR is non-trivial due to the varied abstractions and high complexity of these systems. This paper develops a dependability assessment guidance framework tailored towards AUTOSAR that helps identify the applicability and effectiveness of instrumentation techniques at (a) varied levels of software abstraction and granularity, (b) at varied software access levels - black-box, grey-box, white-box, and (c) the application of interface wrappers for conducting FI.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-1624-8","978-1-4673-1623-1","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263913","AUTOSAR;fault injection;instrumentation;interface wrappers;run-time monitoring","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Data models;Instruments;Monitoring;Software;Standards","automotive engineering;computational complexity;computerised instrumentation;object-oriented programming;quality assurance;safety-critical software;software fault tolerance","AUTOSAR standard;applicability identification;automated instrumentation support;automotive open system architecture;black-box access;component-based automotive software development;dependability assessment guidance framework;fault injection;flexible instrumentation support;grey-box access;high dependability requirements;interface wrapper application;quality assurance;safety-critical functions;software abstraction;software granularity;software-intensive systems;white-box access","","","","1","","23","","","20120809","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the complexity of the machining process injection mold, its optimization as well as its optimal control is difficult to perform. Optimization of the cutting process needs efficient means for determining the optimal cutting parameters in order to minimize machining time and simultaneously preserve the quality of machining surface. With the recent development in CAD/CAM software, manufacturing engineers can proceed with the process planning problems, without knowing functional relationship between process input and process output in advance. In this study, the machining simulation in CATIA is used to obtain the results as initial inputs of optimal analysis. The response surface methodology (RSM) is used to analyze the cutting parameters such as cutting speed, feedrate, radial and axial depth of cut, and machining tolerance. Then this process will be integrated into process chain system that we have developed in the previous research.","","1-4244-0426-6","1-4244-0427-4","10.1109/IFOST.2006.312327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107399","","Analytical models;Computer aided manufacturing;Equations;Machining;Manufacturing processes;Optimization methods;Process planning;Response surface methodology;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness","CAD/CAM;computer aided production planning;cutting;dies (machine tools);machining;moulding;process planning;response surface methodology","CAD-CAPP-CAM system;functional relationship;machining process injection mold;machining tolerance;mold die machining;optimal control;optimal cutting parameters;process planning problems;response surface methodology","","","","0","","8","","","20070220","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a methodical approach to evaluate architecture concepts with regard to standard analysis methods as well as application specific evaluation techniques. We use UML to define the meta-model structure of the system architecture, model the instances of the meta-model using EMF and a generated graphical editor, and perform evaluation operations with the help of an MDE framework.

They can be simulated to verify against requirements and be used as the basis for embedded code generation. The benefits of this approach have prompted many organizations to undertake fairly large effort to migrate their existing Legacy Embedded Software to Model Based Executable Specifications in order to reuse and to leverage their existing control know-how.

We describe the formal model extracted from the TTP specification and its formal verification, using the PVS system. Verification of the central clock synchronization properties is achieved by linking the TTP model of the synchronization algorithm to a generic derivation of the properties from abstract assumptions, essentially establishing the TTP algorithm as a concrete instance of the generic one by verifying that it satisfies the abstract assumptions.

Mastering the development of such systems requires being able to analyze their real-time behavior. Scheduling analysis is the theory that studies how far a real-time system may satisfy its real-time requirements against its real-time properties. In this paper, we will study to what extent it is possible to apply some of those scheduling analysis techniques on real-time systems deployed on AUTOSAR-compliant architectures.

Research and industry have investigated the issue, how to derive test cases to cover test requirements within minimal time. For the automation of all activities related to testing tool support is available. Yet, one question is getting increasingly difficult: How to derive good, i.e. significant test cases, embracing requirements from an external perspective and incorporating knowledge about the internal design and architecture of the system under test (SUT). In this paper we present the use of internal dependences and implementation metrics in combination with an exterior view on the basis of requirements with the aim to profile the test model for the generation of good, i.e. significant test cases. The incorporation of different sources of knowledge of the SUT into test generation reduces the effort to determine test cases for different test goals independently while recreating the knowledge of the SUT in each test process step. We applied the method to a real implementation of automotive functionality in the thermal control unit of a German OEM, that was designed in Matlab Simulink and architectured in AUTOSAR 3.2. The existing test suites were linked with the internal dependences of the Matlab Code, as to assess the reachability of the existing test cases already on the implementation model. In a next step, model metrics were calculated for the implementation modules. They were set into relation with the test cases and code coverage. In doing so, we profiled the test cases and assessed the significance and expressiveness of the model metrics.","","","","10.1109/SIES.2013.6601492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601492","AUTOSAR;Centrality;Component-Dependency-Model;Cyclomatic Complexity;Matlab;Metrics;Simulink;Test Profiling;Thermal Control System;Usage Model","Analytical models;Complexity theory;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Measurement;Testing","automatic test software;automotive engineering;embedded systems;program testing;software architecture;software metrics","AUTOSAR 3.2;German OEM;Matlab Code;Matlab Simulink;SUT architecture;SUT design;automotive functionality;complex multiple functionality devices;component dependency models;embedded systems;implementation metrics;internal dependences;model metrics;system under test;test case determination;test case reachability;test generation;test model;test profiling;test requirements;testing tool support;thermal control unit;usage models","","","","0","","22","","","20130919","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

System modeling based on an architecture description language is a way to keep the engineering information within one information structure. The EAST-ADL was developed in the EAST-EEA project (www.easteea.net) and is an architecture description language for automotive embedded systems. It is currently refined in the ATESSTproject (www.atesst.org). This paper gives an overview of the EAST-ADL and accounts for some recent refinements as developed in the ATESST project.

The schedulability problem is a very important problem needs to be guaranteed in real-time software. In this paper, based on the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL), we present Hybrid Automaton with Relative Time Constraints (HARTC) and Arrival Time Automaton (ATA) to abstract the semantics and external environment of each thread component in AADL respectively. Thus, we translate the schedulability problem in the system modeled by AADL into the reachability problem of locations in the product of HARTCs and ATAs. Then, we study the condition under which the reachability of HARTC is decidable. Under this condition, we develop a schedulability analysis tool called UCaS as a plug-in which can be integrated in the open source tool OSATE. We illustrate the schedulability analysis and simulation result provided by UCaS through an example.

It provides new modeling capabilities such as explicit notion of timebase and symbolic timing expressions. In this paper we propose an approach to simulate and analyze TADL2 timing constraints. The formal semantics of TADL2 is given by an exogenous model transformation in QVTo to the Clock Constraint Specification Language (CCSL), a formal language that implements the MARTE Time Model. With this transformation, the analysis of TADL2 constraints become possible through TimeSquare framework dedicated to the analysis of CCSL specifications.

Realization of location-based services requires new technologies to provide appropriate neighborhood information to moving objects. A general approach to providing neighborhood information to moving objects is to retrieve objects in the neighborhood of a moving object with a spatial query that uses the traditional Euclidean distance. However, if we know the destination and the estimated route of a moving object, we would be able to provide more appropriate information to the object. Based on this idea, we have developed adaptive spatial query generation models that take the trajectory of a moving object into consideration to retrieve desired information. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the neighborhood information retrieval system based on the models and evaluate its effectiveness with experiments.","","0-7695-2103-7","","10.1109/WISEW.2003.1286783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286783","","Appropriate technology;Automotive engineering;Ellipsoids;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Navigation;Prototypes;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","information retrieval systems;mobile computing;query processing;search problems;transforms","Euclidean distance;adaptive neighborhood information retrieval system;adaptive spatial query generation model;digital cartography;global positioning systems;location-based services;mobile devices;mobile users","","","","0","","","","","20040419","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without appropriate preconditions, the integration of mixed-criticality subsystems can lead to a significant and potentially unacceptable increase of engineering and certification costs. A promising solution is to incorporate mechanisms that establish multiple partitions with strict temporal and spatial separation between the individual partitions. In this approach, subsystems with different levels of criticality can be placed in different partitions and can be verified and validated in isolation. The MultiPARTES FP7 project aims at supporting mixed-criticality integration for embedded systems based on virtualization techniques for heterogeneous multicore processors. A major outcome of the project is the MultiPARTES XtratuM, an open source hyper visor designed as a generic virtualization layer for heterogeneous multicore. MultiPARTES evaluates the developed technology through selected use cases from the offshore wind power, space, visual surveillance, and automotive domains. The impact of MultiPARTES on the targeted domains will be also discussed. In a number of ongoing research initiatives (e.g., RECOMP, ARAMIS, MultiPARTES, CERTAINTY) mixed-criticality integration is considered in multicore processors. Key challenges are the combination of software virtualization and hardware segregation and the extension of partitioning mechanisms to jointly address significant non-functional requirements (e.g., time, energy and power budgets, adaptivity, reliability, safety, security, volume, weight, etc.) along with development and certification methodology.","","","","10.1109/DSD.2013.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6628285","dependability;hypervisor;mixed-criticality;model-driven engineering","Certification;Hardware;Multicore processing;Operating systems;Program processors;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","embedded systems;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;multiprocessing systems;public domain software;safety-critical software;virtual machines;virtualisation","MultiPARTES FP7 project;MultiPARTES XtratuM;embedded systems;functional multitude integration;hardware segregation;heterogeneous multicore processor;mixed criticality subsystems integration;multicore virtualization;nonfunctional requirement;open source hypervisor design;partitioning mechanism;software virtualization;spatial partition separation;temporal partition separation","","","","0","","","","","20131015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intelligent agents are used to encapsulate process simulation and performance simulation as well as optimization software packages in order to facilitate the integration of various legacy systems, and more importantly realize the dynamic computing load balancing among a cluster of computers behind the Web server. XML is used for data management at the server side as well as for message exchange among simulation and optimization software agents.

A process map is the basis for the way how a system will be or has been designed. The standard methods and tools for process modeling are mostly used for business process modeling and redesign. Due to the special nature of concurrent engineering processes, a method for process modeling has to be able to support and easily map the high interconnectivity between the process of different engineering disciplines over all hierarchies. The dominant elements in a model for concurrent engineering processes are the informational relations and flows between the different processes. These build the basis for an information-based engineering process. A detailed market study was conducted, in which about 30 tools for business process modeling (e.g. ARIS, Bonapart, IDEF, Facets, etc.) were analyzed and evaluated by a variety of criteria. None of these tools met the requirements of the project partner, not only concerning the method, but also concerning supporting factors like easy and fast input of data, multi-user and database support. Therefore, in order to meet all requirements a special process modeling tool was developed which is based on the same database as the project planning tool already in use. The paper describes the reasons for an engineering process driven modeling method and its use, as well as the rationales for developing a new software tool. Also, lessons learned from this approach are described","","0-7803-5086-3","","10.1109/DASC.1998.741453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=741453","","Automotive engineering;Business process re-engineering;Companies;Concurrent engineering;Continuous improvement;Databases;Documentation;Job shop scheduling;Meeting planning;Process planning","concurrent engineering;engineering computing;graphical user interfaces;scheduling;software tools;systems re-engineering","GUI prototype;concurrent engineering processes modelling;database support;development processes;information-based engineering process;informational relations;integrated systems development;process map;process modeling tool;project planning;project scheduling;reengineering;software tool","","","","1","","7","","","20020806","31 Oct 1998-07 Nov 1998","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Focusing on this task, we develop a test optimization framework using an FSM extended with input variables and clocks, which reflects important features of Simulink/Stateflow statecharts. The test optimization is expressed as the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (ATSP). We show how this approach can be used for solving some testing problems specific to automotive controllers.

Good agreements between predictions and measurements of engine out NOx and soot emissions were achieved. The present computations confirm that methanol allows soot reduction with a little NOx penalty except heavy and full load. With increasing methanol ratio, soot emission decrease markedly while NOx emissions have some increase.

An efficient braking force distribution strategy is proposed then, which assigns the braking force to the regenerative braking as much as possible under the condition that the vehicle possesses good stability during braking process.

CAN is the most widely used automotive communication network having the advantages of being low-cost and providing flexible and robust communication with bounded delay. CAN networks are mainly used for safety-critical real-time applications that have strict timing requirements in communication. This time-criticality makes the CAN schedulability analysis that has been studied over two decades crucial. Most of the previous studies on CAN schedulability assume an idealized communication model, with an unlimited number of transmit buffers in the communication controller. In this paper, we address the CAN schedulability analysis for the case of a single transmit buffer without buffer preemption when the buffering overhead can be ignored. We revisit the existing worst-case response-time analysis for this case that is based on the early, flawed CAN analysis, and we present a revised schedulability analysis.

The reason is that the conducted case studies focus on the isolated application of artefact-based RE approaches in individual socio-economic contexts and, thus, the findings can hardly be generalised. The contribution of this paper is to report on two conducted replication studies to strengthen our confidence on the benefits and shortcomings of applying artefact orientation in RE. To this end, we replicated an industrial case study with partners from two companies. Those replications form part of a research project where all partners are working with the same artefact-based RE approach and its tool-supported realisation. Our results give deeper insights into artefact-based RE and contribute to a reliable database due to comparability among the studies. This allows for first conclusions on the actual impact artefact orientation has on RE.","","","","10.1109/RESER.2013.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664733","Artefact Orientation;Case Study;Evaluation Research;Replication Study;Requirements Engineering","Aerospace electronics;Automotive engineering;Business;Context;Software;Syntactics;Unified modeling language","formal specification;systems analysis","artefact models;artefact-based RE approach;artefact-based requirements engineering;company-wide reference model;impact artefact orientation;interconnected methods;replication study;socio-economic contexts;software requirements specifications","","","","0","","","","","20131114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of this, Siemens has developed an active damping controller for drivetrain oscillations. The basis of the new approach is a state space model of the drivetrain, which includes simplified engine dynamics, the vehicle's inertia, and the elasticity and damping of the driveshaft and gearbox. In conjunction with online measurements, the model provides the basis for a full-state observer, which tracks the corresponding state of the real system.

Existing approaches emphasize the functional properties of the systems but do not consider possible alternative adaptations resulting in system functionality with different grades of quality. In compositional adaptation, the adaptation process should identify not only a feasible system configuration, but a good one. In safety-critical systems such as cars, the adaptation process has to fulfill special requirements. The sequence of reconfiguration activities has to maintain constraints over the entire state trajectory defined by the adaptation process, e.g., that certain processes are always running or even a minimal number of redundant instances. At the same time, in modern cars, many optional processes, such as learning of the engine model or optimization of control processes, improve the performance of the car. Possible optimization objectives are fuel consumption, driving comfort, and wear. Thus, this paper introduces a model of a self-adaptation process by reconfiguration, which considers the quality of alternative configurations. Furthermore, a planning process is introduced that generates a sequence of reconfiguration activities, which result in good configuration. The introduced process can be used to maintain the basic system functionality and also to select the currently most appropriate task implementations and optional tasks to run in a recovered system, e.g. after hardware failures.","","978-1-4244-8537-6","978-0-7695-4232-4","10.1109/SASO.2010.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5630669","Automotive Systems;Planning;Self-Healing","Adaptation model;Automotive engineering;Hardware;Planning;Safety;Software;Trajectory","automotive electronics;electronic engineering computing;optimisation;planning;reconfigurable architectures;safety-critical software;self-adjusting systems;software fault tolerance","optimization;planning;reconfiguration;recovered system;safety-critical systems;self-adaptive systems;self-healing automotive system;state trajectory constraint","","","","1","","23","","","20101111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The introduced architecture consists of a general way to specify multimodal HMI systems based on models with modes, transitions and guards as well as a mechanism to apply adaptations during the runtime process. Adaptations are defined as modifications of models which are specified during the specification process and used during the runtime process to control the program flow. To provide the developer with a flexible but secure way to define personalization uses cases in form of adaption rules we introduce modification boundaries that are defined as an additional model based on the same formalism as the models used for the program flow. The framework will be discussed by means of an example: Analyzing the interaction of the user after a recognition of a yet unknown speech command to infer and apply adequate modifications of the model to connect the unknown speech command with a typical user interaction.","","978-1-4244-5693-2","","10.1109/ACHI.2010.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5430100","Adaptation;Human-Machine Interface;Learning;Modeling;Personalization","Automotive engineering;Computer interfaces;Displays;Humans;Man machine systems;Runtime;Speech analysis;Speech recognition;Technological innovation;Usability","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;software architecture","adaptable human-machine interface environment;model-based personalization;multimodal HMI systems;multimodal interface architecture;program flow control;specification process;user interaction patterns","","","","0","","29","","","20100315","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","22-24 April 2008","2008","","","215","224","Message sequence charts (MSCs) are widely used for describing interaction scenarios between the components of a distributed system. Consequently, worst-case response time estimation and schedulability analysis of MSC-based specifications form natural building blocks for designing distributed real-time systems. However, currently there exists a large gap between the timing and quantitative performance analysis techniques that exist in the real-time systems literature, and the modeling/specification techniques that are advocated by the formal methods community. As a result, although a number of schedulability analysis techniques are known for a variety of task graph-based models, it is not clear if they can be used to effectively analyze standard specification formalisms such as MSCs. In this paper we make an attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a schedulability analysis technique for MSC-based system specifications. We show that compared to existing timing analysis techniques for distributed real-time systems, our proposed analysis gives tighter results, which immediately translate to better system design and improved resource dimensioning. We illustrate the details of our analysis using a setup from the automotive electronics domain, which consist of two real-life application programs (that are naturally modeled using MSCs) running on a platform consisting of multiple electronic control units (ECUs) connected via a FlexRay bus.","1545-3421","978-0-7695-3146-5","","10.1109/RTAS.2008.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550794","Message Sequence Charts / Graphs;Schedulability analysis","Application software;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer science;Control systems;Delay;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Timing;Upper bound","formal specification;scheduling;systems analysis","distributed real-time systems;formal methods;message sequence charts;modeling/specification techniques;performance analysis techniques;schedulability analysis;task graph-based models;timing analysis techniques","","","","0","","27","","","20080627","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to facilitate reuse, and to raise the level of abstraction for future designs and frequently used functions, the employed tool sets offer built-in mechanisms to create sophisticated component libraries. For large, real-world designs, however, it is not always clear, whether or not a certain context violates even the most basic design assumptions of employed library components, thus often leading to expensive runtime errors. This paper introduces a practical method for checking compatibility of large designs, statically. This method not only ensures that large component-based designs provide a context such that all (library) components have well defined types, but it also ensures that transmitted physical units, such as m2, km/h, mph, etc. are preserved during computation. As such the possibility for runtime errors is reduced, and a metric for sound component reuse given.","1089-6503","978-0-7695-2977-6","","10.1109/EUROMICRO.2007.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4301070","","Australia;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Inference algorithms;Libraries;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Measurement units;Runtime","object-oriented programming;reasoning about programs;software libraries;software reusability","component libraries;component-based system compatibility;component-based system reuse;type inference;unit inference","","","","2","","14","","","20070917","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A finite element model of CNG vehicle for rear impact and NVH analysis was created. Using OPTIMUS software with multidisciplinary feasible algorithm which integrated with Pam-Crash and MD Nastran software for collaborative optimization, we made the additional fuel system lighter and fit all requirements. From sensitivity analysis of initial design space we found sensitive ingredient of structure, and built response surface model for these sensitive parts as design parameters base on RBF function. We apply an adaptive evolutionary algorithm with discrete variables to find global optimal solution on response surface.

Cluster supercomputers can leverage commodity parts with standard interfaces that allow them to be used interchangeably to build supercomputers customized for these and other applications. However, the best design for one application is not necessarily the best design for other applications. Supercomputer design is challenging, but this problem is harder due to the huge range of possible configurations, volatile component availability and pricing, and constraints on available power, cooling, and floor space. Cluster design rules (CDR) is a computer-aided engineering tool that uses resource constraints and application performance models to identify the few best designs among the trillions of designs that could be constructed using parts from a given database. It uses a branch-and-bound strategy based on cluster design principles that can eliminate many inferior designs from the search without evaluating them. For the millions of designs that remain, CDR measures fitness by one of several user-specified application performance models. New application performance models can be added by means of a programming interface. This paper details the concepts and mechanisms inside CDR and shows how it facilitates model-based engineering of custom clusters.","","978-1-4244-2232-6","978-1-4244-2233-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510737","","Aerospace engineering;Application software;Automotive engineering;Computational modeling;Computer aided engineering;Design engineering;Drugs;Predictive models;Supercomputers;Weather forecasting","application program interfaces;computer aided engineering;mainframes;parallel machines;workstation clusters","cluster design rules;cluster supercomputers;computer aided engineering;programming interface;resource constraints","","","","0","","38","","","20080507","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

NMPC predicts vehicle position using open-loop dynamics and calculates the optimized wheel steering control input and acceleration control input. A collision avoidance maneuver that does not consider vehicle dynamics may not avoid obstacles. In the worst case, it may transition into another dangerous situation.

We model the problem of procurement network formation (PNF)for multiple units of a single item as a cooperative game where agents cooperate to form a surplus maximizing procurement network and then share the surplus in a stable and fair manner. We first investigate the stability of such networks by examining the conditions under which the core of the game is nonempty.

The engine rotated speed and load signals was transferred to EGR mass flow coefficient signal from Boost program to Matlab Simulink and then called back to Boost program. Therefore, the simulation process about the influence of EGR rates on the whole diesel engine operation process was actualized, provided that EGR rates was continuously changing with diesel engine rotated speed and load when EGR was used in diesel engine. It is proved by simulation results that A/F ratio, cylinder pressure, the temperature in the cylinder and exhaust gas temperature are lower than the original and the gas mass in the cylinder is higher than the original when EGR is used in the diesel engine, but exhaust gas temperature, pressure and EGR mass flow of each cylinder is different when EGR rates are steady, the results also prove that there are deficiencies in the actual diesel engine intake manifold which lead to the uneven distribution of intake air mass and EGR gas in each cylinder, the results were also analyzed.","","978-1-4244-8036-4","","10.1109/ICEICE.2011.5777497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5777497","Control;EGR Rates;Operation performance;Simulation;Turbocharged direct-injected (TDI) diesel engine","Analytical models;Combustion;Diesel engines;Load modeling;Simulation;Software","automotive engineering;diesel engines;flow control;fuel systems","Boost program;EGR control;EGR mass flow coefficient signal;EGR rates;Matlab Simulink;TDI diesel engine;diesel engine operation performance;exhaust gas recirculation;turbocharged direct-injected diesel engine","","","","0","","6","","","20110527","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional approaches use complex 3D heat transfer and CFD or use a 1D network solver for quick prediction of flow and thermal fields. The 1D and 3D models are linked to get an overall system model. However, this coupling procedure can be tedious and time-consuming. This paper introduces a complete thermal modeling methodology that offers approaches for modeling thermal management system combining the benefits of 1D and 3D models in a single system greatly reducing the model development and analysis time. A new software package, ADFlo, developed with the support of the US Army is used to demonstrate these benefits. This approach is applied to the thermal management system for a battery pack where flow balancing of the coolant has a significant impact on the performance of the system. Properly balanced flow will create an even temperature distribution increasing the performance and life of the system. This will be seen on a 3D solid model of the battery. The analyst can use this to study the effects of modification to the cold plate to ensure an even temperature.","1087-9870","978-1-4244-9533-7","978-1-4244-9531-3","10.1109/ITHERM.2012.6231532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231532","3D;CAE;analysis;automotive;cooling;flow network;pressure;system","Batteries;Computational fluid dynamics;Computational modeling;Cooling;Heating;Mathematical model;Solid modeling","battery management systems;battery powered vehicles;computational fluid dynamics;coolants;heat transfer;power engineering computing;solid modelling;temperature distribution;thermal management (packaging)","1D models;1D network solver;3D models;3D solid model;ADFlo;CFD;US Army;battery pack;cell temperature;complex 3D heat transfer;coolant;flow prediction;software package;temperature distribution;thermal battery modeling;thermal fields;variable fidelity methodology","","","","0","","10","","","20120705","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model can deal with the ISP with multi-depots.

ICEs also produce an excessive amount of exhaust emissions. The idea of a Homogeneous Charged Microwave Ignition (HCMI) system is to combine the advantages of a Spark Ignition (SI) and of a Compression Ignition (CI) system. This can make a significant impact on the fuel consumption and the emissions from the combustion process. Through the HCMI system, the fuel inside of the engine cylinder will ignite simultaneously, which will improve the engines efficiency significantly. Computational simulations of a HCMI system are complex and time-consuming and to carry out three dimensional results of multivariable changes a high computational capacity is required. To provide viable simulations this paper compares the location of the Eigenfrequency against the resonance frequency and explores the usability of three dimensional simulations. The Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation software COMSOL is used to model the engine cavity and different optimisation techniques to optimise the certain system design [2]. This paper also investigates the multivariable change of a HCMI system and illustrates the results in a three dimensional graphics.","","978-1-4673-1722-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6330516","Eigenfrequency;Finite Element Method;Homogeneous Charged Microwave Ignition;Internal Combustion Engine","Antennas;Cavity resonators;Combustion;Computational modeling;Ignition;Pistons;Resonant frequency","air pollution;automotive engineering;combustion;energy conservation;finite element analysis;ignition;internal combustion engines;mechanical engineering computing;optimisation;solid modelling","3D graphics;CI system;COMSOL FEM simulation software;HCMI system;SI system;combustion process;compression ignition system;eigenfrequency;energy efficiency;engine cavity;exhaust emission;finite element method;fuel consumption;homogeneous charged microwave ignition system;multivariable simulation;optimisation technique;petrol internal combustion engines;resonance frequency;spark ignition system;three dimensional graphics","","","","0","","5","","","20121015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Manually migrating existing models to a new version of their metamodel is tedious and error-prone. Hence, adequate tool support is required to support the maintenance of modeling languages. COPE provides adequate tool support by specifying the coupled evolution of metamodels and models. In this paper, we present the tool support to record the operations carried out on the metamodel directly through an editor.

IEEE International Conference on","14-17 April 2009","2009","","","1","6","The development of mechatronic products - in particular across the domain borders - is challenging. Possible interdisciplinary improvements are neglected and design inconsistencies are neither prevented nor identified efficiently. Moreover, the complexity of mechatronic products is growing continuously due to an ongoing impact of software on product functions. In addition, the quality of a product is often judged by the quality of its functions. Thus it becomes hard to track the functions of a specific product and how they are realized and the quality of the product functions cannot be assured. Daimler is facing this problem by extending the traditional requirement list with functional requirements in the early design stages. This function oriented product description (FOPD) is leading to a mature product specification, because it is able to grow and adapt while designing the current mechatronic product and the following product generations of one product family. This work presents a novel approach to gain a benefit directly from the FOPD for the succeeding design process. Therefore the authors provide directions for deriving the so-called extended function structure (EFS) from a FOPD. The EFS is enhancing the traditional function structure by considering sensors, actors and the control logic explicitly. This approach will be exemplified in a case study.","","978-1-4244-4194-5","978-1-4244-4195-2","10.1109/ICMECH.2009.4957186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4957186","Design Methodology;Extended Function Structure;Function Oriented Product Description;Functional Modeling;Functional requirements","Automotive engineering;Computer industry;Design methodology;Electrical equipment industry;Electronics industry;Industrial electronics;Logic;Mechatronics;Process design;Software quality","mechatronics;product customisation;product design;product development","design methodology;extended function structure;function oriented product description;functional requirements;mechatronic products;product quality;product requirements;product specification","","","","0","","13","","","20090519","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

As more computing systems are utilized in these safety critical systems, there are high demands for verification and validation (V&V) techniques to assure the reliability of such complex computing systems. However, as the complexity of computing systems increases, conventional V&V techniques such as testing and model checking have limitations, since such systems often control highly complex continuous dynamics. To improve the reliability of such systems, statistical model checking (SMC) techniques have been proposed. SMC techniques can check if a target system satisfies given requirements through statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid SMC technique that integrates sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) technique and Bayesian interval estimation testing (BIET) technique to achieve precise verification results quickly. In our experiment, the new hybrid SMC was up to 20% faster than BIET.

In order to address these problems, strategies to reuse software and a growing emphasis to develop hardware/software co-simulation schemes are gathering strength. The software reuse allows modular design aspects to be promoted and helps in limiting the development efforts needed. The hardware/software co-simulation enables early validation, easy robustness evaluation of the system and reduces the overall development cycles. This article proposes the development and adoption of software reusable blocks that can be in the hardware and/or software domains.

The safety-criticality of the system requires the application of Preliminary Hazard Analysis early in the development process. This is a necessary first step for the development of an automotive embedded system that is acceptably safe. Goal of this activity is the identification and classification of hazards and the definition of top level safety requirements that are the basis for designing a safety-critical embedded system that is able to control or mitigate the identified hazards. A computeraided framework to support Preliminary Hazard Analysis for automotive embedded systems is presented in this work. The contribution consists of (1) an enhancement for Preliminary Hazard Analysis to the domain-specific language EAST-ADL, as well as (2) the identification of properties that indicate the correct application of Preliminary Hazard Analysis using the language. These properties and an analysis model reflecting the results of the Preliminary Hazard Analysis are used for the automated detection of an erroneously applied Preliminary Hazard Analysis (property checker) and the automated suggestion and application of corrective measures (model corrector).

This paper proposes a model for clock drifts and describes their impact on the CAN frame response time distributions. By implementing the clock drifts in a CAN simulation tool, we show experimentally that the response time distributions converge, for drift values chosen randomly within the same range on all ECUs, whatever the initial phasings between the sending nodes. Furthermore, we show that, as a result of the clock drifts, the situations leading to the worst case response times are transient.","1946-0740","978-1-4577-0017-0","978-1-4577-0016-3","10.1109/ETFA.2011.6059186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059186","","Analytical models;Clocks;Graphics;Hardware;Real time systems;Software;Time factors","automotive electronics;clocks;controller area networks;field buses;timing","CAN bus;CAN frame response time distribution;CAN network;CAN simulation tool;ECU;automotive electronic architecture;clock drift;controller area network;data exchange;electronic control units;timing behaviour","","","","3","","15","","","20111024","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Interaction testing is a combinatorial approach that systematically tests all t-way combinations of inputs for a system. In this paper, we report how well interaction test suites (2-way through 5-way interaction test suites) structurally cover a model of the mode- logic of a flight guidance system. We conducted experiments to (1) compare the coverage achieved with interaction test suites to that of randomly generated tests and (2) determine if interaction test suites improve the coverage of black-box test suites derived from system requirements. The experiments show that the interaction test suites provide little benefit over the randomly generated tests and do not improve coverage of the requirements-based tests.

The hardware part is synthesized from a VHDL behavioral description which is also generated from the subset of the functional description allocated to the hardware. The links between hardware and software are also synthesized. Such a procedure and associated tools lead to efficiently obtain system prototypes in an incremental manner.

To this end, the Component Language (COLA) was invented. It allows for the definition of all information needed during system development. For a better understanding, and also debugging, of the systems modeled there with, simulation at the level of the model is a welcome complement. In this paper we present a model-level simulator for COLA. It follows the language's semantics closely, thus guaranteeing the same behavior as specified in the model and implemented by other tools based on COLA. Furthermore, its modular nature allows for the use of different sources for input data.

Highly dynamic maneuverability is achieved via a combination of differential thrust and aerodynamic surfaces (elevons). The relaxed stability, flying wing, tail-sitter configuration, Radio Controlled (RC) airframe is actively stabilized by onboard controllers in three complementary modes of operation, i.e. hover, horizontal flight and aerobatic flight. In hover mode the vehicle flies laterally, similar to a quadrotor helicopter, can maintain accurate position for aiming payload and land with pinpoint accuracy when equipped with a GPS unit. In horizontal and aerobatic modes it flies like an airplane to cover larger distances more rapidly and efficiently. Dynamic modeling and control algorithms have been discussed before for quadrotors [1]-[4] and classical aircraft configurations, as have other VTOL concepts such as tilt-rotors (eg. the V-22 Osprey) and tail-sitters (eg. the Sydney Univ. T-wing and the Convair XFY-1 Pogo) [5]-[6]. The important contributions of this paper are the combined use of differential thrust in multiple axes and aerodynamic surfaces for flight control, the assisted transition between hover and forward flight control modes with pitch rotation of the entire airframe and the elimination of failure-prone mechanisms for thruster tilting. The development and use of highly extensible Open Source Software and Hardware from the Paparazzi project in a transitioning vehicle is also novel. The vehicle is made highly affordable for both researchers and hobbyists by the use of the Paparazzi Open Source Software [16] and its Lisa embedded avionics suite. Careful attention to the mechanical design promotes large scale manufacturing and easy assembly, further bringing down the cost. The materials selected create a highly durable airframe, which is still inexpensive. Modular airframe design enables quick modification of actuators and electron- cs, allowing a greater variety of missions. The electronics are also designed to be extensible, supporting the addition of extra sensors and actuators. Custom designed airfoils provide good payload capacity while maintaining 3D aerobatic flight capability; the wing design ensures adequate stability for manual glide control in non-normal situations. This paper covers the software, mechanical and electronic hardware design, control algorithms and aerodynamics associated with this airframe. Experimental flight control results and the design lessons learned are discussed.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0556-4","","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187313","","Aerodynamics;Aerospace electronics;Aircraft;Automotive components;Payloads;Propellers;Vehicles","aerospace computing;aerospace robotics;aircraft control;mobile robots;public domain software;stability","3D aerobatic flight capability;Lisa embedded avionics suite;Paparazzi open source software;VTOL aerial platform;aerial robotic platform;aerodynamic surfaces;aircraft configurations;autonomous flight mode transitions;differential thrust;dynamic maneuverability;failure-prone mechanism;flight control;flying wing;horizontal flight;hover;mechanical design;modular airframe design;pitch rotation;quadrotor helicopter;quadshot;radio controlled airframe;relaxed stability;tail-sitter configuration;thruster tilting;vertical take-off and landing capability;wing design","","","","1","","35","","","20120419","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the field of system and acceptance testing requirements are the basis for all activities. Although, requirements are often not close to testing. To overcome this we introduced the Timed Usage Model (TUM) as a formal representation of requirements specification. During the creation of the model the requirements are analyzed and brought into an unambiguous and formal representation. Traceability is achieved, as each path in the model must be based upon a requirement. The formulation of the requirements in form of an unambiguous model clarifies the requirements and helps to detect design errors. During the creation of the model omissions and flaws in the requirements are discovered. The model serves as a communication medium when functionality responsibles are involved to clarify these aspects. Timed Usage Models were created for power train functionality and the energy management.

These control laws are designed using the state transformation method applying the Hamilton-Jacobi optimization and Lyapunov stability theory. We design and evaluate high-performance drives and servos. Various servo-systems with radial- and axial-topology actuators are demonstrated and characterized by evaluating analog and digital tracking control laws.

Proceedings. International","22-26 April 2003","2003","","","9 pp.","","Real-time distributed systems are becoming pervasive, supporting a broad range of applications such as avionics, automotive, adaptive control, robotics, computer vision and multimedia. In such systems, several activities are executed on different nodes and cooperate via message passing. One increasingly important concept is that of quality-of-service (QoS), i.e. a system performance metric from the application point-of-view. Concerning the communication system, the QoS delivered to the application is a function of communication parameters such as the rates of message streams. In previous work, the authors have developed two network protocols, FTT-CAN and FTT-Ethernet, which allow online changes to the set of message streams under guaranteed timeliness. The specific network protocols are abstracted away leading to a generic communication paradigm named Flexible Time-Triggered (FTT), which supports online QoS management, with arbitrary policies, in distributed real-time systems. Two possible QoS management policies are referred, priority-based and another one based on the elastic task model, and their use is illustrated with a case study.","1530-2075","0-7695-1926-1","","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213243","","Adaptive control;Aerospace electronics;Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer vision;Message passing;Multimedia systems;Protocols;Real time systems;Robot vision systems","message passing;protocols;quality management;quality of service;real-time systems","FTT-CAN;FTT-Ethernet;QoS management;communication parameters;distributed real-time systems;elastic task model;flexible time-triggered paradigm;generic communication paradigm;guaranteed timeliness;message passing;message streams;network protocols;quality-of-service;real-time distributed systems;system performance metric","","","","10","","","","","20030728","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept of services is used in two consecutive model layers with well-defined semantics leading from a black-box description of the system to a white-box model which consists of communicating services. Due to the precise semantics of a service and the interaction of services, the service models can be directly refined to a logical component architecture which in turn integrates into the development of a concrete implementation of the overall system","","0-7695-2772-8","","10.1109/ECBS.2007.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4148951","","Aerospace electronics;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Component architectures;Computer architecture;Concrete;Informatics;Intserv networks;Software systems;Systems engineering and theory","software architecture","black-box description;multifunctional software systems;reactive system;software-based system;system architecture;system functionality;white-box model","","","","1","","25","","","20070410","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since in the series configuration the engine is mechanically decoupled from the traction wheels, for a given power request the steady-state engine operating point is chosen to maximize the efficiency. A control algorithm regulates the transitions between different operating points by using the battery to smoothen the engine transients, thereby improving efficiency. Because of the constrained nature of the transient-smoothing problem, we implement the control algorithm by model predictive control. The control strategy feedback law is synthesized and integrated with the powertrain control software in the engine control unit.

Although many factors impact safety of highway transportation, at-grade intersection spacing is by far one of the most important factors. In reality, many situations can lead to closely neighbored intersections which become major causes of traffic accidents. To improve safety, intersection spacing should guarantee that vehicles from upstream intersection can be stabilized before coming to the next intersection. Therefore, minimum intersection spacing should be satisfied. By exploring characteristics of traffic flows released from upstream intersection, the paper has put forward a study approach, which analyzes safety state of vehicles by examining speed index CSV (coefficient of speed variance). Using microscopic traffic simulation software TSIS (traffic software integrated system), simulation models for the study have been built up and calibrated. Finally, based upon analysis of data from simulation, standards for minimum intersection spacing of highways are given.","","978-1-4244-1786-5","978-1-4244-1787-2","10.1109/ASC-ICSC.2008.4675396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675396","","Analysis of variance;Automotive engineering;Data analysis;Microscopy;Road accidents;Road safety;Road transportation;Software systems;Traffic control;Vehicle safety","automated highways;road accidents;traffic engineering computing","at-grade intersection spacing;highway transportation;microscopic traffic simulation;traffic accidents;traffic engineering;traffic flows;traffic software integrated system","","","","0","","8","","","20081117","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

EmCodeSyn is an attempt to create a formal semantics based visual framework for specifying safety critical applications such as automotive control, avionics fly-by-wire control, etc. In contrast with SIMULINK/Stateflow, LabVIEW and other visual tools, EmCodeSyn is based on a synchronous programming paradigm akin to the polychronous language SIGNAL. The formalism on which this work is based, is called MRICDF (multi-rate instantaneous channel connected data flow). The specification formalism has relational semantics, which enables static rate-analysis for scheduling the computation in the code generation stage. Hierarchical data flow specification with minimal amount of control specification makes it easier for designers to compose existing MRICDF models to create larger ones. Once the feasibilty of an MRICDF design is verified, code synthesis is performed by the tool to generate C code. EmCodeSyn design methodology provides a visual framework for generating verifiable deterministic code from synchronous specification based on MRICDF formalism.","1636-9874","","978-2-9530504-1-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5404049","","Application software;Clocks;Debugging;Design methodology;Equations;Flow graphs;Network synthesis;Software safety;Software tools;Synchronous generators","embedded systems;formal specification;program compilers;program debugging;programming language semantics;safety-critical software","C code;EmCodeSyn;MRICDF;automotive control;avionics fly-by-wire control;code generation;code synthesis;embedded applications;formal semantics;multirate data flow specifications;multirate instantaneous channel connected data flow;polychronous language SIGNAL;safety critical applications;scheduling;static rate-analysis;synchronous programming;visual debugging","","","","1","","15","","","20100202","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the fuel spray process could promote more air involving, the fuel spray would be atomized finer, then the combustion, power performance and fuel economy would be better, and the soot will be formed less but more NO<sub>x</sub>. Through comprehensive evaluation function, the compromise scheme is chosen which is compromised with better fuel economy, higher power performance, and low NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions.

The reuse of free-form feature information is achieving significant attraction in geometric modeling. Wavelet and its multiresolution analysis theory in CAGD/CG and CAD domains have been found to be very effective in treating geometric modeling and free-form feature surface design due to its properties of localization both in time/spatial and frequency domains. We introduce the fundamentals of wavelet and wavelet multiresolution analysis, and discuss how wavelet multiresolution technology is applied to design reuse for free-form feature shapes design by virtue of the wavelet decomposition and reconstruction algorithm. The approach indicates that the design information reuse of free-form feature surface not only improves the efficient of surface design, but is of great benefit to the surface modification and editing, and definite shape semantics, etc. We develop a multi-agent distributed system architecture environment supporting design information reuse.

It is shown that proper routing constraints can greatly reduce noise on susceptible nets and reduce noise on all nets in general. A software package to automatically generate router constraints base on EMI considerations is being developed to simplify the routing process. For experimental validation of the Quantic software, simple test structures were fabricated, tested and compared to simulation predictions. Also, a comparison of the coupled noise on the motherboard with an MCM versus three individual surface mount packages shows that the MCM significantly reduces the conducted emissions at the system level. Effective design of automotive MCM's with proper consideration to EMI requirements can substantially reduce conducted emissions from an engine controller unit onto the wiring harness.

The case study covers a real engine assembler serving from their local premises to clients all over the world, with variable demands and calendars. The core of the global tool is a set of MILP model which calculates working calendars for six different sections of a factory, taking into account production rates defined by the company, its internal and external suppliers working calendars and the union requirements. Moreover, the real system had requirements that are not usually considered on APP literature. The model has been designed and calibrated in a prototype-validation iterative process and has been optimized to calculate scenarios with an acceptable computational time within planners' expectative.

The HILS method incorporates hardware components in the numerical simulation environment, and this yields results with better credibility than pure numerical simulations. In this study, HILS systems have been developed for active brake control systems: ABS (anti-lock brake system), TCS (traction control system), and ESP (electronic stability program). The system consists of the hardware part that includes the hydraulic brake mechanism and the ECUs, the software part that virtually implements the vehicle dynamics with visualization, and the interface part that links these two parts together.

Modeling and simulation provides a cost-effective measure to carry out preliminary component, system (hardware and software), and mission testing and verification, thereby reducing the number of potential failures in at-sea trials. An accurate simulation can help engineers to find hidden errors in the AUV embedded software and gain insights into the AUV operations and dynamics. This paper reviews our research work on real-time physics-based modeling and simulation for our AUVs. The modeling component includes vehicle dynamics, environment and sensor characteristics. The simulation component consists of stand-alone versus hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) implementation, for both single as well as multiple vehicles.

In order to fully leverage the advantages of graphical models, it is necessary to provide extensive automation support. Automation can potentially be applied to software design analysis, verification, validation, and automatic code generation. The automation requires a clear and concise definition of the graphical design and implementation specification. A unique approach has been established that permits Computer Aided Control System Design (CACSD) models to be prepared with software design information that is compatible with various commercial software support tools and internally developed tools. The neutral design approach permits implementation decisions to be deferred until late in the development cycle. This permits the optimal target processor, real time operating systems (RTOS), test tools, and automatic code generation tools to be selected once all of the system requirements are known and modeled in the CACSD tool. In order to realize a software implementation, it is critical to establish a mapping between specification and implementation. This paper describes the neutral software design specification approach and how the specification is used in design, testing, and automatic code generation.

Most of existing SOA design methodologies advocate identifying services from the top-down decomposition of business processes. However, the identification quality in these methodologies heavily depends on the expertise and experience of individual designers. The ability to quantitatively evaluate service identification is absolutely needed. In this paper, we propose an approach that supports such evaluation by applying the measurement technology to the service-based business process decomposition. A model to capture related architectural elements with their relationships is presented. A set of design metrics are proposed for measuring various features of identified services in the service portfolio, including service granularity, coupling, cohesion, and business entity convergence. To apply the approach, a prototypical measurement tool for service identification is developed. An automotive work order scenario is used as an illustration example to explain our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness.","","978-1-4244-5183-8","978-0-7695-3811-2","10.1109/SCC.2009.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283960","","Automotive engineering;Buildings;Design methodology;Electronic mail;Laboratories;Portfolios;Prototypes;Service oriented architecture;Standardization;USA Councils","business data processing;software architecture;software metrics;software performance evaluation;software quality","business entity convergence;design metrics;identification quality;measurement technology;service cohesion;service coupling;service granularity;service identification evaluation;service-based business process decomposition;service-oriented architecture","","","","7","","15","","","20091013","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

But for extremely complex product families like a vehicle manufacturer's product range, they become very large, and thus cumbersome and inflexible. This is particularly true when changes to the tree's structure have to be managed and documented over a long period of time. Furthermore, a conflict of aims arises when using feature trees in large organizations: while a single global feature tree for the entire company is desirable, local amendments are indispensable because often some applications of the feature models require amendments not visible in other application contexts. A research project at DaimlerChrysler, being conducted in cooperation with the Technical University of Berlin, has examined this problem in detail and elaborated an approach based on a distribution of the feature tree definition over several hierarchical levels. Using this approach, amendments to the feature structure can be introduced locally at first, and can later become valid in a broader context, if desired. Currently the approach is being evaluated and refined in case studies.","","0-7695-2425-7","","10.1109/RE.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531078","","Automotive engineering;Consumer electronics;Context modeling;Instruments;Manufacturing;Marketing management;Organizing;Technology management;Testing;Vehicles","formal specification;software reusability;tree data structures","complex organizational structure;domain analysis;domain modeling;feature modeling;feature reuse;feature tree;requirements reuse;tree structure","","","","3","","","","","20051114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Held jointly with 6th International Conference on Embedded Systems., 20th International Conference on","6-10 Jan. 2007","2007","","","3","3","Information security is a critical concern in a wide range of embedded computing and communications systems. Embedded systems are being used in critical applications (medical electronics, automotive systems, and avionics), where the consequence of security attacks can be severe. Several business models (e.g., distribution of multimedia content, mobile e- commerce, etc.) require an adequate level of security in the associated electronic systems in order to be viable. On the other hand, the increasing complexity and networked nature of embedded systems has led to many vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be easily targeted for security attacks. IBM's Global Business Security Index Report (2005) projected ""the aggressive spread of viruses and worms to handheld devices, cell phones, wireless networks, car and satellite systems, and other embedded computers"" as a major emerging trend. If our past experience is any indication, conventional approaches to security or simple add-on security schemes are insufficient. Adequate security can be achieved in a system only if security is considered throughout the design process, including the design of the SoCs (HW and embedded SW). It is therefore imperative that SoC architects, HW designers, and embedded SW developers be aware of the security challenges and techniques to address them. This tutorial will introduce security challenges in embedded systems, identify the security requirements for SoCs that they contain, and present approaches to designing secure SoCs. Secure SoC design will be described as an attempt to bridge three ""design gaps"" - the assurance gap, performance gap, and battery gap. Examples from various state-of-the-art commercial SoCs will be used to illustrate the presented concepts. The tutorial will be organized into the following parts: part 1. security concerns in embedded systems and challenges in secure SoC design; part 2. efficient security processing architectures - bridging the performance/battery gaps- - ; part 3.

There is a trend towards transforming steered tracked vehicles to skid-steered wheel vehicles for high speed at the expense of reduced mobility. Skid-steered vehicles turn by generating different longitudinal forces at the tires due to the application of different torques to the wheels on the opposite side of the vehicle. Conventional vehicles, however, cannot generate an opposite driving force at each side wheel. Using an independent steering and driving system, six-wheel vehicles can show better performance than conventional vehicles. Hybrid steering is a combination of skid steering in the load velocity and the steered wheel system at high speed. This steering enhances maneuverability under low speed and stability at high speed. This paper describes a 6WS/6WD vehicle for hybrid steering in three parts: the Vehicle Model, the Control Algorithm for Hybrid Steering, and a Simulation. First, the vehicle model is an application of the TruckSim software for 6WS and 6WD. Second, the hybrid steering control algorithm describes the optimum tire force distribution method for energy savings. The last is simulation and verification.","","978-1-4244-7453-0","978-89-93215-02-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5670130","6×6 vehicle;6-wheel drive;6-wheel steer;Energy minimization;Optimum tire force distribution method;TruckSim;Virtual steering Angle","Force;Stability analysis;Tires;Torque;Turning;Vehicles;Wheels","automotive engineering;military vehicles;off-road vehicles;steering systems","6WD vehicles;6WS vehicles;TruckSim software;driving control algorithm;energy savings;hybrid steering control algorithm;independent steering control algorithm;military;off-road operation;optimum tire force distribution method;skid-steered wheel vehicles;steered tracked vehicles;steered wheel system","","","","0","","6","","","20101217","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To perform such interactions in a seamless manner, the actors need to be aware of not only their physical context (e.g. location) but also their changing relationships with respect to the particular task or goal. The latter interaction-oriented context, which we refer to as social context, has significant impacts on the way actors manage their adaptive behavior. However, very little research has focused on supporting such social context in ubiquitous environments. This paper presents our novel approach to modeling and realizing social context. Social context is modeled as a managed composition of loosely-coupled roles with their interaction relationships expressed as contracts. In addition, it is modeled from an individual actor's perspective to allow for possible differences in the actors' perception of the relationships. The social contexts of an actor are externalized from the actor itself to achieve easy management of the actors' adaptive behavior concerning interaction. A layered system architecture is introduced to realize the approach and demonstrate the development of automotive telematics systems that are physically and socially context-aware.","","978-963-9799-59-2","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6835","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326396","Context-awareness;SOA;adaptation;pervasive computing;social context;software architecture","Automotive engineering;Collaboration;Computer Society;Computer architecture;Context awareness;Context modeling;Contracts;Pervasive computing;Telematics;Ubiquitous computing","social aspects of automation;software architecture;ubiquitous computing","automotive telematics systems;interaction awareness;loosely-coupled roles;socially context-aware;ubiquitous computing environments","","","","5","","28","","","20091110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

While Reynolds number varies from 1.5times10<sup>4</sup> to 2times10<sup>5</sup>, both the drag coefficient and the lift coefficient have great changes. However, while Reynolds number varies from 2times10<sup>5</sup> to 5times10<sup>6</sup>, both the drag coefficient and the lift coefficient have very small changes and become smoother. Details of the flow field and transitional positions at several Reynolds numbers were presented by numerical simulation. The impact on aerofoil force coefficient caused by the changes of Reynolds number was also presented by the experiment.

In front of this work, we have applied a software product line engineering and model driven development to our product line development, in which we have ever developed more than 30 products by assembling software components without hand coding. In this previous experience, we found that product developers tended to make excessive effort on verification and testing because of the fear of feature interaction problems. This prevented improving the productivity of software development. In order to address this issue, we propose accumulating the results of feature interactions that have ever appeared in the past products so that the product developers can focus their testing effort on interactions that first appear in their product without worrying about the implementation details. Then they will have confidence in their product configuration. We believe that the variation management with respect to the feature interactions will encourage the developers and promote the introduction of software product line engineering.","","978-1-4577-1029-2","","10.1109/SPLC.2011.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030055","feature interaction;feature modeling;product lines;test coverage;variation management","Adaptation models;Automotive engineering;Lattices;Product development;Programming;Software;Testing","software development management","cumulative coverage;feature interactions;hand coding;product configuration;product developers;product line development;software components;software product lines;variation management","","","","0","","22","","","20110929","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its main software includes a monitor software running in the monitor computer, a vision rendering software running in the vision computer and Matlab/Simulink-based simulation model running in simulation computer. When designing its monitor software, a graphical user interface driven-by S-function method is adopted to eliminate the delay in the displaying of the simulation data. The vision rendering software uses a parametric adjustment method based on the principle of optical projection, improving the driver's perception of being immersed in the virtual traffic scene. The application of the developed platform is demonstrated by HIL experiments of vehicle actuators and DIL experiments of adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm. These experiments not only demonstrate the potential merit of the platform of speeding up DAS development, but also illustrate that the proposed control algorithms for actuators possess good tracking capability, as well as that the developed ACC algorithm is capable of improving driver comfort and reducing driver workload.","1751-956X","","","10.1049/iet-its.2009.0041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478404","","","adaptive control;driver information systems;graphical user interfaces;monitoring;rendering (computer graphics);virtual machines","DAS actuators;Matlab-Simulink-based simulation model;S-function method;adaptive cruise control algorithm;car mock-up;computer monitor;computer simulation;driver workload;driver-in-the-loop;driving assistance systems;driving simulation platform;graphical user interface;hardware-in-the-loop;optical projection;parametric adjustment method;virtual traffic;virtual traffic scene;vision computer;vision rendering software","","","","1","","","","","20100603","","IET","Institution of Engineering and Technology","IET Journals & Magazines"

The following simulation expresses that the car interior noise implemented laminated door glass is better than the one using tempered door glass in high frequency, and the thicker glass is not useful obviously for reducing high frequency noise. If the total thickness and PVB (polyvinyl butyral) film are same and only modify the thickness of the outer glass and inner glass, the sound pressure level of car interior noise will be affected not so much.

However, VR based digital manufacturing methods and software require perfect 3D models of whole manufacturing system in a virtual environment to implement target systems. This means that modeling tasks for new system configuration increase useless expenses and efforts. Unlike VR technology, AR (Augmented Reality) technology superimposes required virtual objects on real time image of physical manufacturing environment. Therefore, modeling time and cost for new manufacturing system can be dramatically reduced using AR technology. In this paper, the methods of design and implementation by using AR technology for the automobile assembly process such as the automobile spare tire inserting are introduced. Moreover, methods such as a multi-marker coordinate system, a threshold image, a clipping plane for virtual objects and so on, are proposed to generate the operation program for the automobile assembly process.

For verifying development artifacts, model checking is a well-established technique in single system development. However, existing model checking approaches do not incorporate the product line variability and are hence of limited use for verifying domain artifacts. In this paper we present an extended model checking approach which takes the product line variability into account when verifying domain artifacts.

We implemented a significance test for correlation and used this test to dynamically adjust the batch sizes used in confidence interval estimation done using batch means. When the stability conditions have been met, the simulation prompts the user to consider stopping the simulation. On the other hand, if at the end of the run length selected by the user, the statistical conditions were not satisfied, the tool notifies the user of that fact. This capability enabled us to significantly reduce the simulation run lengths, and ensures, with little additional computational effort, that the results were reliable.

This paper provides a new functional complexity metric that can be derived from the specification and can be used to estimate the total number of test cases required. Further, ECUs need to be verified and validated in accordance with their operational profile. Testing with operational profile will be cost effective with better reliability confidence. At the same time operational profile based testing can speed-up the V&V process by allocating the resources in relation to use and criticality. In this paper, the operational profile method is applied, as a case study, to the front and rear fog light ECU. Methods for deriving function points, functional complexity, computing the number of test cases, developing operational profiles, and test case allocation are presented.

However, there are some fundamental incompatibilities between BPMN and BPEL, which make it difficult to generate BPEL code for implementation from BPMN models.The aim of this paper is to investigate the synergic uses of BPMN and BPEL to model and implement executable business processes. To that end, we propose a Business Process Modelling framework. Then we apply it to a real life business process scenario involving a typical manufacturing process in the automotive industry.

The framework enables a process that organizes the creation of engineering competency models. The resulting competency models can be employed within a human resources (HR) talent management system. The framework can also be used by individuals to characterize their capabilities independent of a specific role. Individuals can use this characterization to compare their capabilities with many roles. Summing competencies of the individuals within an organization and comparing the result to an organizational competency model provides a means of examining the total capabilities of an organization and a means of identifying organizational capability gaps. The model framework was derived using a bottoms-up approach. All of the applicable knowledge, skills, behaviors and abilities are organized in a multi-dimensional and hierarchal manner. The multi-dimensional aspect allows organizations to add or subtract dimensions depending on the breadth of activities performed by the particular organization. The model framework is easy to use and to implement in a Web based computer program.","","978-1-4244-2149-7","978-1-4244-2150-3","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2008.4518980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4518980","Competency Model;Framework;Human Resources","Automotive engineering;Contracts;Finance;Financial management;Human resource management;Knowledge engineering;Organizational aspects;Software packages;Space vehicles;Testing","human resource management;organisational aspects","Web based computer program;human resources talent management system;multi-dimensional hierarchal engineering competency model;role-specific engineering competency models","","","","0","","7","","","20080514","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Optimization of the hydrodynamic performance of an in-service AUV","Hearn, G.E.; Murphy, A.J.; Fallows, C.D.; Furlong, M.","Southampton Oceanogr. Centre, Southampton Univ., UK","OCEANS 2003. Proceedings","22-26 Sept. 2003","2003","3","","1187 Vol.3","","The AUV, AUTOSUB, developed by the Ocean Engineering Department of the Southampton Oceanography Centre is a versatile vehicle for the collection of scientific data. It has been used successfully worldwide for a range of missions over recent years including two beneath the Antarctic ice-shelf. In parallel with its in-service programme there is ongoing research to monitor and improve its performance. In particular means to increase mission range and versatility are sought. This paper describes methods for improving the hydrodynamic performance of in-service AUVs. The AUV propulsion system has been analysed and this has demonstrates that significant improvement to vehicle range should be possible by reduction of drag and increased propeller efficiency. In addition improving the control algorithms will enable more complex mission tracks to be undertaken. As part of the programme for drag reduction a means of quantifying appendage resistance on practical in-service AUVs has been developed, together with the means to reduce it. To this end, towing tank experiments using a captive model of AUTOSUB to accurately determine the total drag, its components and sources have been carried out. Regions of excessive flow disturbance around critical parts of the body are identified using flow visualisation. The results of these experiments are used to develop a means of predicting the effects of body attitude, control surface angle, and mission dependent appendages on vehicle performance. From this, algorithms are developed which enable optimum size, shape and position of mission dependent appendages to be determined. A simple trial is described which enables the efficacy of these algorithms to be verified. This trial provides an economic means of measuring the propulsion performance of the actual vehicle in-service. To further reduce drag, different hull coatings could be applied. To this end, the effectiveness of compliant surfaces in reducing drag by delaying the transition from l- > - > aminar to turbulent flow has been investigated. To enable the development of improved control algorithms, a computer simulation has been developed. Estimates of the manoeuvring derivatives have been used to develop a three dimensional simulation of AUTOSUB. This is used to establish the effect of changes in control system algorithms to determine their effect on range and manoeuvrability. It is also being used in the development of mission planning and evaluation software.","","0-933957-30-0","","10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282529","","Antarctica;Automotive engineering;Data engineering;Drag;Hydrodynamics;Marine vehicles;Monitoring;Oceans;Propellers;Propulsion","geophysics computing;hydrodynamics;oceanographic techniques;underwater vehicles","3D computer simulation;AUTOSUB;AUV propulsion system;Antarctic ice-shelf;Ocean Engineering Department;Southampton Oceanography Centre;actual vehicle in-service;automated underwater vehicles;body attitude effect;control system algorithm change;critical part;drag reduction;excessive flow disturbance;flow visualisation;hull coating;hydrodynamic performance;in-service AUV;manoeuvrability;mission dependent appendage;optimization;optimum size;propeller efficiency;propulsion performance;quantifying appendage resistance;software evaluation;towing tank experiment;transition from laminar;turbulent flow;vehicle performance","","","","0","","","","","20040413","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, a methodology based on the probabilistic combination of RPNs is improved further. An RPN is calculated for every cause of failure by multiplying together severity, occurrence, and detection ratings (values between one and ten).

Each sub-problem can be formalised in a step-wise manner as a separate sub-model. To introduce the phenomena shared amongst the subproblems, the sub-models are reconciled. We propose a reconciliation process in the Event-B formal language based on the shared-variable and the shared-event styles which were originally developed for a model decomposition. The advantages and disadvantages of shared-variable and the shared-event reconciliation steps are also discussed. The requirements of an automotive cruise control system are decomposed and formalised as sub-models.

Distributed scheduling of replicated tasks, however, violates this requirement if on-line scheduling, preemptive scheduling, or scheduling of dissimilar replicated task sets is employed. This problem of inconsistent task outputs has been solved previously by coordinating the decisions of the local schedulers such that replicated tasks are executed in an identical order. Global coordination results either in an extremely high communication effort to agree on each schedule decision or in an overly restrictive execution model where on-line scheduling, arbitrary preemptions, and nonidentically replicated task sets are not allowed. To overcome these restrictions, a new method, called timed messages, is introduced. Timed messages guarantee deterministic operation by presenting consistent message versions to the replicated tasks. This approach is based on simulated common knowledge and a sparse time base. Timed messages are very effective since they neither require communication between the local scheduler nor do they restrict usage of on-line flexible scheduling, preemptions and nonidentically replicated task sets","0018-9340","","","10.1109/12.833107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833107","","Application software;Automotive electronics;Communication system software;Costs;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Operating systems;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Software safety","fault tolerant computing;processor scheduling;real-time systems","deterministic operation;distributed scheduling;fault-tolerant real-time systems;flexible scheduling;hard real-time dependable systems;preemptions;replica determinism;timed messages","","","","21","11","35","","","20020806","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such metrics are especially of interest if no quantitative data is available but only the qualitative process architecture is at hand, e.g. as a process chart. In this paper, different metrics from software and workflow engineering (McCabe Complexity, Control-flow Complexity, Activity / Passivity) are used on a qualitative model of a process incorporating decision points.

The architecture must be concerned by concepts like coach, player, player's role, play/move, formation, tactic and strategy, in order to plan and play ""correctly"" a match. Although there exists other works using these terms, their definitions are not standardized, leading to confusion because they use the same term for different concepts. We propose a definition closer to human soccer facilitating the description of particular instances of players, tactics and strategies. In this way, a human soccer coach can express his ideas and apply them to a robotic soccer match.

A situation-dependent modification of recording parameters allows for a detailed profiling of vehicle-related errors. We developed a data-flow oriented model, in which data streams are connected by processing nodes. These nodes filter and aggregate the data and can be connected in nearly any order, which permits a successive composition of the aggregation and recording strategy. The integration with an event-condition-action model provides adaptability of the processing and recording, depending on the state of the vehicle. In a proof-of-concept system, which we implemented on top of the automotive diagnostic protocols KWP and UDS, the feasibility of the approach was shown. The target platform was an embedded on-board computer that is connected to the OBD-II interface of the vehicle.

There is a big effort done by many international and local companies to produce car security systems, but the result is still less than expectations since the number of car theft cases are still increases. The thieves are developing their capabilities and inventing smarter and stronger stealing techniques which require more powerful security systems. This research project proposes an Automobile Monitoring and Tracking Model to solve this issue. It introduces a powerful security model that can send SMS and MMS to the owner to have fast response especially if the car is nearby. This paper focuses on using MMS and database technology, the picture of the intruder will be sent to user or police.

Executable assertions, i.e., special instructions that check some invariant properties of a program, provide a powerful and low-cost method for on-line detection of hardware-induced control flow faults. We propose a technique called ACFC (Assertions for Control Flow Checking) that assigns an execution parity to a basic block, and uses the parity bit to detect faults. Using a graph model of a program, we classify control flow faults into skip, re-execute and multi-path faults. We derive some necessary conditions for these faults to manifest themselves as execution parity errors. To force a control flow fault to excite a parity error, the target program is instrumented with additional instructions. Special assertions are inserted to detect such parity errors. We have a developed a preprocessor that takes a C program as input and inserts ACFC assertions automatically. We have implemented a software-based fault injection tool SFIG which takes advantage of the GNU debugger. Fault injection experiments show that ACFC incurs less performance overhead (around 47%) and memory overhead (around 30%) than previous techniques, with no significant loss in fault coverage.","","0-7695-1968-7","","10.1109/OLT.2003.1214380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214380","","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Costs;Fault detection;Instruments;Laboratories;Performance loss;Registers;Rivers;Testing","embedded systems;fault location;fault simulation;fault tolerant computing;transients","ACFC;GNU debugger;arbitrary user-inserted assertions;assertions for control flow checking;basic block;control flow assertions;control flow fault;embedded computer systems;executable assertions;execution parity errors;fault coverage;graph model;hardware-induced control flow faults;memory overhead;multipath fault;on-line fault detection;parity bit;performance overhead;program invariant properties;reexecute fault;skip fault;software-based fault injection tool","","","","29","1","","","","20030722","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, even when there has been developed models which pretend to helps SMEs in the implementation of software process improvements, one of the main barrier that stopping SME's to implement software process improvements are the lack of knowledge and support of software process improvement.

On the other hand, the expected requirements in a software tool focus on providing support for SMEs in the implementation of software process improvements initiatives (SPI).","","978-1-4673-5096-9","","10.1109/CERMA.2012.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6524568","SMEs;SPI;Software tools;requirements;small and medium enterprises;software process improvement","","resource allocation;small-to-medium enterprises;software process improvement;software tools","SME;SPI initiatives;resource management;small and medium enterprises;software development organizations;software process improvement;software process initiatives;software tool;success factors;support tools","","","","0","","38","","","20130610","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Davis and K.A. Jordan, 1990). They describe a concept of requirements as a sphere (of requirements) surrounded by a Lucite box. The idea is that requirements may be viewed from a variety of perspectives (e.g. data flow diagram (DFD), object-oriented analysis (OOA), finite state machine (FSM), Statechart, etc.) represented as sides of the transparent box,but that these perspectives have common characteristics which may be represented in a metamodel. While DJRM may be an excellent vehicle for allowing requirements engineers to view requirements from a variety of perspectives, model neglects two important players in the requirements process: the user and the customer. It is proposed that a mapping is possible from the DJRM into an existing rapid prototyping tool and a pictorial system simulation tool which, when augmented by a user interface design concept layer, is capable of specifying the external behavior of an interactive system from the user's view. The level of completeness of this specification is directly dependent upon the completeness of the DJRM representation","","0-8186-3040-X","","10.1109/IWRSP.1991.218616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=218616","","Automata;Automotive engineering;Design engineering;Design for disassembly;Interactive systems;Object oriented modeling;Software systems;User interfaces;Vehicles;Virtual prototyping","digital simulation;formal specification;software prototyping;software tools;user interfaces","DJRM representation;Davis-Jordan requirements metamodel;Lucite box;common characteristics;completeness;existing rapid prototyping tool;external behavior;interactive system;metamodel;pictorial system simulation tool;requirements engineers;software requirements;specification;transparent box;user interface design concept layer","","","","0","","1","","","20020806","11 Jun 1991-13 Jun 1991","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Efficient power co-estimation techniques for system-on-chip design","Lajolo, M.; Raghunathan, A.; Dey, S.; Lavagno, L.","Politecnico di Torino, Italy","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition 2000. Proceedings","2000","2000","","","27","34","We present efficient power estimation techniques for HW/SW System-On-Chip (SOC) designs. Our techniques are based on concurrent and synchronized execution of multiple power estimators that analyze different parts of the SOC (we refer to this as co-estimation), driven by a system-level simulation master. We motivate the need for power co-estimation, and demonstrate that performing independent power estimation for the various system components can lead to significant errors in the power estimates, especially for control-intensive and reactive embedded systems. We observe that the computation time for performing power co-estimation is dominated by: (i) the requirement to analyze/simulate some parts of the system at lower levels of abstraction in order to obtain accurate estimates of timing and switching activity information and (ii) the need to communicate between and synchronize the various simulators. Thus, a naive implementation of power co-estimation may be too inefficient to be used in an iterative design exploration framework. To address this issue, we present several acceleration (speedup) techniques for power co-estimation. The acceleration techniques are energy caching, software power macromodeling, and statistical sampling. Our speedup techniques reduce the workload of the power estimators for the individual SOC components, as well as their communication/synchronization overhead. Experimental results indicate that the use of the proposed acceleration techniques results in significant (8× to 87×) speedups in SOC power estimation time, with minimal impact on accuracy. We also show the utility of our co-estimation tool to explore system-level power tradeoffs for a TCP/IP network interface card sub-system and an automotive controller","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840011","","Acceleration;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Control systems;Embedded system;Error correction;Independent component analysis;Information analysis;Performance analysis;System-on-a-chip","application specific integrated circuits;circuit simulation;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;iterative methods;low-power electronics","TCP/IP network interface card sub-system;automotive controller;communication/synchronization overhead;computation time;concurrent execution;energy caching;hardware-software codesign;iterative design exploration;power co-estimation techniques;reactive embedded systems;software power macromodeling;statistical sampling;switching activity information;synchronized execution;system-level power tradeoffs;system-level simulation master;system-on-chip design","","","","12","","23","","","20020806","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of these useful virtual prototyping tools are driving simulators.Driving simulators are usually special purpose facilities, which are developed by suppliers individually for a specific application purpose. Most of the conventional driving simulators provide some flexibility for constructing new test scenarios, but do not allow users to change system arrangementor add or remove subsystems without indepth know-how of the driving simulator structure.This paper describes the concept and main idea of a reconfigurable driving simulator for testing ADAS.

"Model-based runtime analysis of distributed reactive systems","Bauer, A.; Leucker, M.; Schallhart, C.","Inst. fur Inf., Technische Univ. Munchen, Germany","Software Engineering Conference, 2006. Australian","18-21 April 2006","2006","","","10 pp.","","Reactive distributed systems have pervaded everyday life and objects, but often lack measures to ensure adequate behaviour in the presence of unforeseen events or even errors at runtime. As interactions and dependencies within distributed systems increase, the problem of detecting failures which depend on the exact situation and environment conditions they occur in grows. As a result, not only the detection of failures is increasingly difficult, but also the differentiation between the symptoms of a fault, and the actual fault itself, i.e., the cause of a problem. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient approach for analysing reactive distributed systems at runtime, in that we provide a framework for detecting failures as well as identifying their causes. Our approach is based upon monitoring safety-properties, specified in the linear time temporal logic LTL (respectively, TLTL) to automatically generate monitor components which detect violations of these properties. Based on the results of the monitors, a dedicated diagnosis is then performed in order to identify explanations for the misbehaviour of a system. These may be used to store detailed log files, or to trigger recovery measures. Our framework is built modular, layered, and uses merely a minimal communication overhead - especially when compared to other, similar approaches. Further, we sketch first experimental results from our implementations, and describe how it can be used to build a variety of distributed systems using our techniques.","1530-0803","0-7695-2551-2","","10.1109/ASWEC.2006.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1615057","","Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Embedded system;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Information systems;Real time systems;Runtime","distributed processing;embedded systems;fault tolerant computing;system monitoring;system recovery;temporal logic","distributed reactive systems;failure detection;linear time temporal logic;model-based runtime analysis;safety properties","","","","7","","28","","","20060508","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The claim of this work is that linking requirements, their scenario-based formalizations, and software verification provides a promising extension to this approach. Formalized scenarios, for example in the form of low-level assume/assert statements in C, are easier to trace to requirements than traditional test sets. For a verification engineer, they offer an opportunity to better participate in requirements changes. Changes in requirements can be more easily propagated because adapting formalized scenarios is often easier than deriving and updating a large set of test cases. The proposed idea is evaluated in a case study encompassing over 50 functional requirements of an automotive software developed at Robert Bosch GmbH. Results indicate that requirement formalization together with formal verification leads to the discovery of implementation problems missed in a traditional testing process.","1090-705X","978-0-7695-3761-0","","10.1109/RE.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328506","bounded model checking;functional requirements;verification","Automotive engineering;Computer industry;Computer science;Control systems;Formal verification;Joining processes;Programming;Safety;Software testing;System testing","formal specification;object-oriented programming;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;software maintenance;systems analysis","C statement;component requirement change;functional requirement review;scenario-based formalization;software testing;software traceability policy;software verification","","","","1","","20","","","20091117","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, FMEA is traditionally done manually which makes it both time-consuming and costly, specially for large and complex systems. Also, small modifications in the design may result in a complete revision of the initial FMEA. This paper presents a tool support for automated incremental component-based FMEA of SW and HW. It is based on component safety interfaces and a formal compositional safety analysis method. This tool support enables engineers to focus on more important steps in the safety assessment process. Also, during system upgrades, the tool incrementally registers the changes and identifies possible effects in the FMEA which enables the use of earlier safety analysis results. Finally, this formal approach based on design models of the components and the system always creates FMEAs which are consistent with the system design.","","978-3-9810801-3-1","978-3-9810801-4-8","10.1109/DATE.2008.4484792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4484792","","Aerospace industry;Aerospace safety;Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Failure analysis;Hardware;Information analysis;Information science;Software safety;System analysis and design","object-oriented programming;safety-critical software;software fault tolerance","FMEA technique;automated incremental component-based FMEA;component safety interfaces;component-based fault tolerant systems;hardware complexity;incremental failure mode and effects analysis;safety assessment process;safety-critical systems;software complexity","","","","2","","18","","","20080411","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based CAN are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based CAN, but are detected and contained on router-based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems.","","978-1-4673-2685-8","978-1-4673-2683-4","10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356590","","Automotive engineering;Multicast communication;Routing;Security;Software;Topology","computer network security;controller area networks;software maintenance","CAN router;CAN systems security;automotive applications;automotive domain;bus-based CAN;controller area network;denial-of-service attacks;eavesdropping;failure propagation;legacy CAN based systems;message fabrication;power train;router-based CAN;safety domain;safety-critical subsystems;star coupling router;trust model","","","","1","","24","","","20121124","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, we constructed a model-checking based approach to verify state reachability, a fundamental safety property, of Rhapsody statecharts. We implemented it in a prototype tool using the model checkers CBMC and SPIN.

A main motivation for this is cost and available data rate. A critical issue in the adoption of Ethernet in these domains is the timing of frame transfers, as many relevant applications require a guaranteed low-latency communication in order to meet real-time constraints. Ethernet AVB is an upcoming standard which addresses the timing issues by extending the existing strict-priority arbitration. Still, it needs to be evaluated whether these mechanism suffice for the targeted applications. For safety-critical applications, this can not only be done using intuition or simulation but requires a formal approach to assure the coverage of all worst-case corner cases. Hence, we present in this paper a formal worst-case analysis of the timing properties of Ethernet AVB and strict-priority Ethernet. This analysis mathematically determines safe upper bounds on the latency of frame transfers. Using this approach, we evaluate different topologies for a typical use-case in industrial automation.","","978-1-4673-2685-8","978-1-4673-2683-4","10.1109/SIES.2012.6356564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356564","","Analytical models;Delay;Equations;Mathematical model;Real-time systems;Time factors","audio signal processing;local area networks;multimedia communication;safety-critical software;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication standards;video signal processing","AVB switching;Ethernet AVB;Ethernet topology;automotive;avionics;communication standard;data rate;distributed embedded system;formal worst-case timing analysis;frame transfer;industrial automation;low-latency communication;real-time constraint;safety-critical application;strict-priority Ethernet","","","","0","","25","","","20121124","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then at the second step, the rest of the jobs will be put into an in-house computer system which assigns jobs to its internal fleet of vehicles according to some greedy rules and the remaining jobs that cannot be served by the internal fleet of vehicles will be outsourced.

We conduct regression analyses (OLS and Tobit) utilizing project management data collected at an American automotive parts supplier over the six years between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2008. Our empirical analysis can be summarized by three key findings. First, the adoption of the new integrated R&D process increased the frequency of specification changes that presumably helped to improve the effectiveness and stability of in-vehicle LAN network system. Second, the new process significantly raised a number of flaws caught during the development, and thus improved product quality observed after the shipment.

EASTADL is an architecture description language dedicated to automotive embedded system design with focus on structural and functional modeling. The behavioral description is not integrated within the execution semantics, which makes it harder to transform, analyze, and verify EAST-ADL models. Model-based techniques help to address this issue by enabling automated transformation between different design models, and providing means for simulation and verification. We present a way of integrating architectural models and verification techniques, which has been implemented in a tool called ViTAL. Consequently, ViTAL provides the possibility to express the functional EAST-ADL behavior as timed automata models, which have precise semantics and can be formally verified. The ViTAL tool enables the transformation of EASTADL functional models to the UPPAAL PORT tool for model checking. This method improves the verification of functional and timing requirements in EAST-ADL, and makes it possible to identify dependencies and potential conflicts between different vehicle functions before the actual AUTOSAR implementation.","","978-1-4673-2156-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6299228","model-based techniques; verification; analysis; UPPAAL PORT; EAST-ADL; Model transformation;","Analytical models;Automata;FAA;Semantics;Timing;Unified modeling language","automata theory;automotive engineering;formal verification;mechanical engineering computing;software architecture","AUTOSAR;EASTADL functional models;UPPAAL PORT tool;ViTAL;architectural models;architecture description language;automotive embedded system design;functional modeling;model checking;model-based techniques;model-driven development;structural modeling;systems architecture;timed automata models;verification tool","","","","1","","","","","20120913","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The variations and distributions of the grain size in each character region during stretching were simulated. It shows that the equivalent strain increases with increasing the stretching reduction, which leads to an increase in the dislocation density and results in a dynamic recrystallization of the grain. The grain size decreases with increasing the stretching reduction. The distribution of the equivalent strain during stretching is nonuniform, the center of forging P<sub>1</sub> is the easy deformation region, having the maximum equivalent strain; the contact areas P<sub>2</sub> between the forging and the upper or lower anvils is the difficult deformation region, having the minimum equivalent strain; the wall side area of forging P<sub>3</sub> is the middle deformation.

"Temporal Partitioning of Communication Resources in an Integrated Architecture","Obermaisser, R.","Vienna Univ. of Technol., Vienna","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on","April-June 2008","2008","5","2","99","114","Integrated architectures in the automotive and avionic domain promise improved resource utilization and enable a better coordination of application subsystems compared to federated systems. An integrated architecture shares the system's communication resources by using a single physical network for exchanging messages of multiple application subsystems. Similarly, the computational resources (for example, memory and CPU time) of each node computer are available to multiple software components. In order to support a seamless system integration without unintended side effects in such an integrated architecture, it is important to ensure that the software components do not interfere through the use of these shared resources. For this reason, the DECOS integrated architecture encapsulates application subsystems and their constituting software components. At the level of the communication system, virtual networks on top of an underlying time-triggered physical network exhibit predefined temporal properties (that is, bandwidth, latency, and latency jitter). Due to encapsulation, the temporal properties of messages sent by a software component are independent from the behavior of other software components, in particular from those within other application subsystems. This paper presents the mechanisms for the temporal partitioning of communication resources in the dependable embedded components and systems (DECOS) integrated architecture. Furthermore, experimental evidence is provided in order to demonstrate that the messages sent by one software component do not affect the temporal properties of messages exchanged by other software components. Rigid temporal partitioning is achievable while at the same time meeting the performance requirements imposed by present-day automotive applications and those envisioned for the future (for example, X-by-wire). For this purpose, we use an experimental framework with an implementation of virtual networks on top of a time division mu- - ltiple access (TDMA)-controlled Ethernet network.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2007.70232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378343","Design;Distributed Systems;Distributed architectures;Fault-tolerance;Infrastructure protection;Network communications;Real-time and embedded systems;Real-time distributed;System architectures;System integration and implementation;integration and modeling","","automotive engineering;avionics;computer networks;embedded systems;object-oriented programming;resource allocation;software architecture","DECOS integrated architecture;TDMA-controlled Ethernet network;automotive domain;avionic domain;communication resource temporal partitioning;dependable embedded software component system;integrated architecture;resource utilization;time division multiple access;virtual network","","","","1","1","47","","","20080502","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As with most engines, the usual aim is to achieve a high work output with a high efficiency, and hence, control design is imperative. Subsequently, essential is the existence of a simulation model in order to give designer the ability to explore the merits of alternative designs without physically building the systems.

Accordingly, ACI model of FM communication system is established, and the influence of ACI interference is estimated through calculating the distortion of the speech signal demodulated.

Here, out-of-the-box approaches were inappropriate due to poor scalability, inappropriate tool support, and the need to use decentralized variability models.

IEEE","5-9 Oct. 2008","2008","","","1","5","The application of SiC devices (as battery interface, motor controller, etc.) in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) will benefit from their high-temperature capability, high-power density, and high efficiency. Moreover, the light weight and small volume will affect the whole power train system in a HEV, and thus performance and cost. In this work, the performance of HEVs is analyzed using PSAT (powertrain system analysis tool, vehicle simulation software). Power loss models of a SiC inverter are incorporated into PSAT powertrain models in order to study the impact of SiC devices on HEVs. Two types of HEVs are considered. One is the 2004 Toyota Prius HEV, the other is a plug-in HEV (PHEV), whose powertrain architecture is the same as that of the 2004 Toyota Prius HEV. The vehicle-level benefits from the introduction of the SiC devices are demonstrated by simulations. Not only the power loss in the motor controller but also those in other components in the vehicle powertrain are reduced. As a result, the system efficiency is improved and the vehicles consume less energy and emit less harmful gases. It also makes it possible to improve the system compactness with simplified thermal management system. For the PHEV, the benefits are more distinct. Especially, the size of battery bank can be reduced for optimum design.","0197-2618","978-1-4244-2278-4","978-1-4244-2279-1","10.1109/08IAS.2008.366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4659154","","Analytical models;Batteries;Costs;Hybrid electric vehicles;Mechanical power transmission;Performance analysis;Power system modeling;Silicon carbide;Software performance;Thermal management","automotive electronics;hybrid electric vehicles;power transmission (mechanical);silicon compounds;wide band gap semiconductors","PSAT;SiC;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;powertrain system analysis tool;vehicle powertrain;vehicle simulation software","","","","6","","10","","","20081024","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major hurdle is the current reliance on outmoded field hardware and software. A systematic approach to traffic engineering software development could provide significant advantages with regard to software capability, flexibility and maintenance. Improved traffic controllers will likely be essential for many of the proposed intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) applications. This paper describes the roadway traffic control problem generally and introduces a computable language that can be used for constructing real time traffic control software. This computable language is designed to be configured by a graphical user interface that does not require extensive software engineering training to use, yet provides much more flexibility and capability than possible by simply changing program parameters. The model is based upon the function block metaphor commonly used for constructing robust and efficient real time industrial control systems. The software model has been implemented in C on an open architecture traffic controller (OATC) hardware platform and demonstrated under simulated conditions for applications such as signalized intersection control, ramp metering, and communications with existing traffic control devices.

The paper illustrates the feasibility of our proposal when database proxies are used to manage the data communication between components and to perform run-time monitoring on the virtual function bus.

Thus, the development of tracking systems utilizing efficient state estimators is very important. In this case, problems such as moving platform carrying the sensor and maneuvering targets could introduce large errors in the state estimation and in some cases can lead to the divergence of the filter. In order to avoid sub-optimal performance, the unscented Kalman filter is chosen, while a new curvilinear model is applied which takes into account both the turn rate of the detected object and its tangential acceleration, leading to a more accurate modeling of its movement. The performance of the unscented filter using the proposed model in the case of automotive applications is proven to be superior compared to the performance of the extended and linear Kalman filter.","","0-7803-9286-8","","10.1109/ICIF.2005.1592006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592006","Tracking;automotive applications;curvilinear;estimation;filtering;unscented","Acceleration;Application software;Automotive engineering;Filters;Object detection;Roads;State estimation;Vehicle detection;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicle safety","Kalman filters;road vehicle radar;safety systems;sensor fusion;state estimation;target tracking","active sensor;automotive safety application;curvilinear motion model;maneuvering target tracking system;passive sensor;state estimation;tangential acceleration;unscented Kalman filter design","","","","7","","6","","","20060213","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The understanding of architectural drivers enables the later engineering tasks including evaluation of architectural alternatives. Systems engineering guidelines provide models and advice for what information entities to consider, but only limited proposals of how to proceed. In this paper, we device and present a method to perform analysis of architectural drivers and we apply it to an industrial case of developing a hybrid electric drive system for heavy automotive applications. We present data on what practitioners expect from such a method, we present the method and rationale, and preliminary results from applying the method to the case. We note that the process and information model are fairly general and could be considered useful for any developer of a complex system. We believe the proposed method closes some of the gap between the general models described in the system engineering guidelines and an industrially applicable method.","","978-1-4673-3107-4","","10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549961","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549961","architectural requirements;architecture analysis;automotive systems;system architecture","","automotive engineering;electric drives;hybrid electric vehicles;software architecture","architectural driver;automotive application;hybrid electric drive system;system architecture engineering","","","","0","","11","","","20130701","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the UTS PHEV should be governed by one special energy management strategy (EMS) particularly in different time intervals, such as the transition from motor to generator. From the system view, the performance analysis of the whole car have been done by the help of PSAT software so as to decide main dimensions for the drive configurations, and brief comparisons are made to the fuel economy and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between traditional HEV and UTS PHEV. After that, for continuous working based the sole machine, more strict requests are put forward to the drive system, mainly including high torque/power density, good thermal dissipation capability, great flux weakening ability for high speed cruising, strong mechanical redundancy capability, etc. As per these tough requirements, qualitative and quantitative comparisons are made on different types of drive machines, especially on those series of stator-mounted permanent magnet machines (SMPMMs), including double salient permanent magnet machine (DSPMM), flux reversal machine (FRM), and flux switching permanent magnet machine (FSPMM). Then one new axially laminated flux switching permanent magnet machine (ALFSPMM) is proposed, which stator and rotor are laminated in parallel to the axis. It can make full usage of PM flux linkage and reduce the core loss particularly in the high excitation frequency. Based on the 2D model prediction by finite element algorithm (FEA), the ALFSPMM has lower cogging torque, higher torque density, greater flux weakening ability, higher efficiency, etc., and hence it can be regarded as one ideal candidate for the UTS PHEV drive system. In order to save time and expense, one prototype with 2 kW has been built up - nd more detailed experiments will be available in near future.","","978-1-4673-0802-1","978-1-4673-0801-4","10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6342582","","Acceleration;Engines;Ice;Stator windings;Torque;Vehicles","AC motor drives;automotive electrics;electric generators;electric motors;hybrid electric vehicles;permanent magnet machines;rotors;stators","UTS PHEV;double salient permanent magnet machine;drive machine;electric machine;electrical drive system;energy management strategy;flux reversal machine;flux switching permanent magnet machine;fuel economy;greenhouse gas;hybrid electric vehicles;plug-in HEV;rotor;stator mounted permanent magnet","","","","1","","27","","","20121110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It facilitates detailed “budget” level cost estimates. It has been successfully applied to a major satellite concept development. The CEM described is comprised of integrated detailed engineering and cost estimating relationships describing the performance, characteristics, and design parameters of the components and subsystems required for a space-based infrared sensing system. Models have been developed to evaluate design parameters. The automated interconnectivity between subsystem models using spreadsheet software allows for the quick assessment of the system design impacts due to requirement changes.

In this paper, we present FlowTalk, a new object-oriented programming language aimed at making software development for wireless embedded sensor devices easier. FlowTalk is an object-oriented programming language in which dynamicity (e.g., object creation) has been traded for a reduction in memory consumption. The event model that traditionally comes from using sensors is adapted in FlowTalk with controlled disruption, a light-weight continuation mechanism. The essence of our model is to turn asynchronous long-latency operations into synchronous and blocking method calls.

Sophisticated systems that are safe and environmentally friendly require numerous types of sensor data, which are collected from various devices and sent to computers through networks. To develop such large-scale distributed embedded systems with high dependability and productivity, we have developed a virtual execution environment platform. This platform integrates numerous CPU simulators and various device simulators through the network and provides network-wide simulation functionalities. In this paper, we describe a fast CPU simulator and controlled object simulation for testing control software in a virtual software execution environment. The virtual environment integrates a CPU simulator and a controlled object simulator in order to test functional behaviors of embedded control software. The environment enables the developer to test control software at the same execution rate as a real system without the source codes.

The system to be specified was the set of embedded systems responsible for driver and passenger comfort. The focus of the specification process was on software requirements. The basic idea was to assign and hire supplementary staff to do the job. At first glance, the overall effort of about 100 person-months to obtain the requirements specifications needed may seem quite high. Nevertheless, we are convinced that this expense represents an excellent investment. The point is that the obtained high-quality, uniform and well-structured requirements stored in a single requirements management database can be efficiently reused in subsequent development cycles for future passenger car models. This partial reuse of specifications promises two major advantages: better specifications in less time","","0-7695-1125-2","","10.1109/ISRE.2001.948596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=948596","","Automotive engineering;Computer industry;Data mining;Embedded system;Lighting;Mirrors;Quality management;Stability;Systems engineering and theory;Technological innovation","automobile industry;automobiles;automotive electronics;embedded systems;formal specification;personnel;product development","Mercedes-Benz Technology Center;automotive industry;core development team workload;development cycles;development time;driver comfort;embedded systems;expense;high-quality requirements specifications;investment;partial specification reuse;passenger car models;passenger comfort;requirements management database;software requirements;supplementary staff;unstructured information;well-structured requirements reuse","","","","0","","","","","20020807","27 Aug 2001-31 Aug 2001","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be able to measure qualitative aspects of x-by-wire systems at the abstract level of architecture, this article introduces a class of timed Petri-Nets which allows for the modeling and simulation of such systems.

Frequent interaction with its environment, e.g., by sending or reading data over the microcontrollers I/O lines, lies in the nature of embedded systems. Thus, making the long-standing problem of explicit-model checking even worse, namely the state-explosion problem. This paper presents a concept to tackle these difficulties by using a 3-valued logic in the state representation and showing its benefits in terms of state-space savings whenever logic operations are executed by the target microcontroller. To highlight the effectiveness of this approach, termed <i>delayed</i> <i>nondeterminism</i> <i>with</i> <i>look</i> <i>ahead</i>, an embedded program exemplifying typical microcontroller source code is analyzed and the resulting state space sizes are discussed.

As a safety-critical system, its safety and reliability are uttermost important. ISO 26262 adapted from IEC 61508 provides a V-model as a reference process model for different phases of product development. In this paper, DFMEA (design failure mode and effects analysis) and FTA (fault tree analysis) complied with ISO 26262 are taken to analyze the safety aspects of EPS so as to enhance the safety and reliability of EPS. Firstly, the EPS system is decomposed into subsystems and components, and the familiar failure modes and undesired top events are separately divided into several categories. Then a comprehensive DFMEA for every single potential failure mode is carried out without omission as far as possible. The qualitative FTA is put into practice to identify the weak link as well. Since the DFMEA and FTA for EPS are finished, countermeasures for each potential hazard should be taken to guarantee the safety and reliability of EPS which are always achieved by fault detection and fault isolation algorithms of EPS hardware and software. Besides, some preventive actions are also taken in the early design stage to find out the potential causes.","","978-1-4799-1014-4","","10.1109/QR2MSE.2013.6625550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625550","DFMEA;EPS;FTA;ISO 26262;preventive actions;system structure tree","Automotive engineering;ISO standards;Power systems;Reliability engineering;Safety;Torque","IEC standards;ISO standards;automotive components;fault diagnosis;fault trees;hazards;road safety;steering systems","DFMEA;EPS hardware;EPS software;EPS system;FTA;IEC 61508;ISO 26262;V-model;car;design failure mode and effects analysis;electric power steering system;fault detection algorithm;fault isolation algorithm;fault tree analysis;hazard;product development;reference process model;reliability improvement;safetycritical system","","","","0","","","","","20131010","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

After that, detailed friction analysis of the main bearing has been performed. The numerical prediction (such as the oil film pressure, the asperity contact pressure and the oil film thickness etc.) was obtained and compared with the experimental data. The result has shown a good agreement between them so as to offer a scientific basis for main bearing design.","","978-1-4244-8036-4","","10.1109/ICEICE.2011.5776934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5776934","Hydrodynamic lubrication;Main Bearing;Multi-body dynamics;Oil Film","Analytical models;Equations;Films;Hydrodynamics;Load modeling;Lubrication;Mathematical model","Navier-Stokes equations;automotive engineering;elastodynamics;friction;hydrodynamics;internal combustion engines;lubrication;machine bearings;mechanical engineering computing","AVL-Excite software platform;Navier-Stokes equation;Reynolds equation;asperity contact pressure;bearing friction analysis;continuity equation;elastohydrodynamic;hydrodynamic lubrication model;internal combustion engine;multibody dynamics;oil film pressure;oil film thickness","","","","0","","9","","","20110527","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The determination of the 3D model from multiple images is of key importance. One of the most important difficulties in autonomous 3D reconstruction is the (automatic) selection of the ""significant"" points which carry information about the shape of the 3D bodies i.e. are characteristic from the model point of view. Another problem to be solved is the point correspondence matching in different images. In this paper a 3D reconstruction technique is introduced, which is capable to determine the 3D model of a scene without any external (human) intervention. The method is based on recent results of image processing, epipolar geometry, and intelligent and soft techniques. Possible applications of the presented algorithm in vehicle system dynamics are also presented. The results can be applied advantageously at other engineering fields, like car-crash analysis, robot guiding, object recognition, supervision of 3D scenes, etc,, as well.","","978-1-4244-1442-0","978-1-4244-1443-7","10.1109/SISY.2007.4342616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342616","3D reconstruction;car-body deformation modeling;crash analysis;epipolar geometry;features extraction;fuzzy image processing;image understanding;information enhancement;perspective geometry;point correspondence matching","Application software;Automotive engineering;Computer vision;Image reconstruction;Intelligent vehicles;Layout;Mobile robots;Remotely operated vehicles;Shape;Vehicle dynamics","computer vision;image matching;image reconstruction;vehicle dynamics","autonomous 3D model reconstruction;car-crash analysis;computer vision;epipolar geometry;image matching;image processing;intelligent applications;intelligent techniques;object recognition;robot guiding;vehicle system dynamics","","","","1","","20","","","20071008","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, the use of hybrid processes as basic processes that are able to be fitted in similar processes in differents quality models and standards is discussed. Moreover, the definition of hybrid processes in order to provide a support in the creation of processes compatible in different models and standards is included.","","978-1-4577-1879-3","","10.1109/CERMA.2011.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125867","","IEC standards;ISO standards;Organizations;Process control;Software;Standards organizations","IEC standards;ISO standards;small-to-medium enterprises;software metrics;software prototyping;software standards","CMMI Dev 1.3 model;ISO/IEC 15504-ISO/IEC 12207:2008 standards;SME;agile methodology;hybrid measurement process;small and medium enterprises;software product quality","","","","0","","21","","","20120109","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since they equally refer to software and hardware components in which they are implemented, these models call for more heterogeneous design languages, with a larger granularity range too. At the level of design and verification languages, some standards have risen up, like UML, AADL, but none of them is driven by a standard methodology. To be able to follow the requirements traceability, at each step of the life cycle, we need a methodology that states for bidirectional links between each granularity level and each development level. In this article, we propose an approach based on systematic reuse of low-level concepts (borrowed from an algorithm language like +CAL and a programming language like Ada) into encapsulated algorithm structures which are implemented into the highest conceptual levels of development (e.g. from the UML and AADL component models). These structures are only activated and enriched as they advanced with the life cycle. Therefore, some new concepts presents from the beginning of the design, will play an important role in the further development steps without being explicitly expressed from the beginning.","","0-7695-2895-3","","10.1109/ICECCS.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276335","","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Computer languages;Design engineering;Design methodology;Domain specific languages;Hardware;Real time systems;Unified modeling language;Yarn","formal specification;formal verification;software architecture;specification languages","RT architecture;hardware components;heterogeneous design languages;requirements traceability;software components;verification languages","","","","0","","12","","","20070723","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Variant trace ability in SPL is crucial in the context of different tasks, like change impact analysis, especially in complex global software projects. In addition, trace ability concepts must be extended by partly automated variant configuration mechanisms to handle restrictions and dependencies between variants. Such variant configuration mechanism helps to reduce complexity when configuring a valid variant and to establish an explicit documentation of dependencies between components. However, integrated variant management has not been sufficiently addressed so far. Especially, the increasing number of software variants requires an examination of traceable and configurable software variants over the software lifecycle. This paper emphasizes variant trace ability achievements in a large global software engineering project, elaborates existing challenges, and evaluates an industrial usage of an integrated variant management based on experiences.","","","","10.1109/ICGSE.2013.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613082","integrated feature modeling;software product line;traceability","Automotive engineering;Calibration;Complexity theory;Context;Process control;Software;Software engineering","automobile industry;program diagnostics;software engineering","SPL;automotive domain;complex global software projects;global software engineering project;integrated variant management;software lifecycle;trace ability concepts;variant configuration mechanism","","","","0","","","","","20130930","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the discontinuance of military handbook Mil-Hdbk-217, reliability prediction of electronic equipment, and the limited environmental applications of Telcordia SR-332, reliability prediction for electronic equipment, this paper evaluates the reliability analysis center's (RAC) PRISM® software tool as a potential improved methodology in predicting the field reliability of military systems. This evaluation compares the PRISM® predicted failure rate to the actual observed field failure rate for three military electronics units. While initial results showed the predicted failure rate to be approximately one-half of the observed field failure rate, the ratio of predicted failure rate to observed field failure rate was consistent across three independent systems. Furthermore, the PRISM® methodology has features such as process grade factors and field failure data incorporation through Bayesian analysis which show promise in allowing a more accurate field reliability prediction to be generated. As a point of comparison, the initial failure rate prediction by Raytheon is opposite to an earlier assessment performed by TRW automotive where field data was not factored in through the use of PRISM's® Bayesian analysis option (M.G. Priore, et al., 2002). TRW automotive found a predicted failure rate that was twice the observed field failure rate. This paper discusses Raytheon's assessment of the PRISM® software tool including the reason for choosing PRISM®, application of the PRISM® prediction methodology to three military electronic units, and analysis of the prediction results. This paper also discusses future plans for refinements in the use of PRISM's® features to produce a more accurate reliability prediction of field performance.","","0-7803-8215-3","","10.1109/RAMS.2004.1285420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285420","","Aerospace electronics;Application software;Automotive engineering;Bayesian methods;Electronic equipment;Failure analysis;Military aircraft;Military equipment;Predictive models;Software tools","belief networks;electronic equipment testing;failure analysis;military computing;military systems;reliability;software tools","Bayesian analysis;Mil-Hdbk-217;PRISM®;Raytheon assessment;TRW automotive;electronic equipment;field failure prediction tool;field reliability performance;military electronics units;military handbook;reliability analysis center's;reliability prediction;software tool","","","","1","","","","","20040824","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

During execution of the generated source code, FISCADE controls the SCADE simulator to execute the model, inject the fault, and log the results. The tool allows the user to inject errors (activated faults) in all signals in the model. Furthermore FISCADE can simulate specification of design errors by automatically replacing operators with fault injection nodes, as well as simulating transient, intermittent or permanent faults affecting memories and CPU registers.

In most cases examined, a transient fault tolerance strategy was superior to the permanent fault tolerance strategy previously in use for the range of transient fault arrival rates expected in aerospace systems.

The intend of this paper is to present problems and solutions of top research initiatives from diverse angles with the common denominator of the dire need for run-time adaption: The first part tackles the thermal problem i.e. high power densities and the related short and long-term effects it has on the reliability and it presents scalable techniques to cope the related problems. The second section demonstrates the potential of steep slope devices on thread scheduling of multi-cores. The third approach presents embedded pipelined architectures running complex multi-media applications whereas the fourth section introduces the paradigm of invasive computing i.e. a novel computing approach promising high efficiency through a highly-adaptive hardware/software architecture.

We illustrate the potential of applying program analysis tools on problems in controller design and implementation by focusing on concolic execution, a technique for systematic testing for software. In particular, we demonstrate how a concolic execution tool can be modified to automatically analyze controller implementations and (a) produce test cases achieving a coverage goal, (b) synthesize ranges for controller variables that can be used to allocate bits in a fixed-point implementation, and (c) verify robustness of an implementation under input uncertainties.

Due to their flexibility, Web Services easily combine, in a common and coherent framework, ubiquitous computing with heterogeneous applications composed of different kinds of resources and, typically distributed in many organizations. We expect that this technology will follow the same evolution paths that have characterized other technologies so far, with some specificity due to the openness and size of the application context. In this connection, optimizations tied to invocations and workflows are assuming a primary role in Web Services research. The synchronous request/reply nature of the most diffused underling protocol (HTTP) introduces several restrictions in many application scenarios. On the other hand, asynchronous interactions are allowed by using message oriented middleware platforms, like JMS, which are typically harder to handle than object- and process-oriented middleware. In this paper, we propose a first implementation of a module that allows for dynamic Web Services invocations, which, on the basis of metadata added to WSDL, is able to select the most appropriate invocation technique for calling a Web Services operation.","","1-4244-0910-1","1-4244-0910-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228147","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Collaboration;Distributed computing;Message-oriented middleware;Object oriented modeling;Processor scheduling;Protocols;Ubiquitous computing;Web services","Web services;distributed object management;grid computing;message passing;meta data;middleware;remote procedure calls;ubiquitous computing","WSDL;Web services;Web-based distributed applications;client-side implementation;diffused underling protocol;dynamic asynchronous invocations;grid computing;heterogeneous applications;message oriented middleware;metadata;object-process-oriented middleware;ubiquitous computing","","","","0","","28","","","20070611","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The functional part of a specification is then obtained by the combination of a finite number of services.

Physical prototyping of each permutation during design cycles is time-intensive and expensive. Use of full-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers may be impractical for system-level analyses because of: (a) typically large manual efforts needed for grid generation; and (b) long simulation times. There is a need, therefore, for simulation and design tools based on reduced models that will enable rapid, system-level, thermal-fluidic analyses. In this paper, we describe a multi-resolution flow-thermal simulation approach and prototype software tool for thermal management of electronics packages in large systems. This method offers higher efficiency than CFD analyses in terms of computational resources and time. Our demonstration example is related to flow-thermal analysis of a simple vehicle model containing multiple electronics packages. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used for rapid modeling of the electronics components and subsystems. The tool is capable of performing fully-resolved (CFD), mixed-resolution (CFD-ANN), and reduced-model (ANN) flow-thermal simulations.

The aim of such a system is to achieve a desired climatic condition in the vehicle interior which leads to a higher comfort for the passengers and therefore it also increases indirect the safety in road traffic. The climatic condition is defined by the interior temperature, its layering, the humidity and the velocity of the airflow blowing through the passenger compartment. For the adjustment of the desired interior climate with the available air conditioning components complex control algorithms are necessary. This control task is performed by the climate controller, which includes all control strategies in form of software programs. Beneath the construction of all system parts, a further challenge is the design of the control which includes the design of the controller hardware as well as the control strategies. By applying modern structured development methods for mechatronic systems like the modified V-model [VDI 2206, 2004] the development time and the costs can be reduced whereas the quality can be improved by using a model based approach. Fundamental part of this strategy are the X-in-the-loop-simulation (XIL-simulation) methods, where all system parts, which can be pure virtual in form of models or real elements, are considered in interaction. This is done for verification and validation of the system parts and the software. By using this technique in the concrete case of the climate controller, its hardware as well as the applied control strategies can be tested and optimized in conjunction with a real time computer that is connected to the controller via appropriate interfaces. Models running on t- he real time computer simulate the air conditioning system. Thus it is possible to close the control loops in a partially virtual system. In contrast to this approach, conventional development strategies, where most control loops can be considered for the first time at the assembled system, are very time consuming and cost intensive because real test drives have to be carried out for the verification and validation processes. This is especially essential for tests under different climatic conditions like summer and winter tests. In case of the software- and hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (SIL- and HIL-simulation) for an air conditioning controller, models of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning elements (HVAC) and the passenger compartment are necessary. A main demand for the HIL-Simulation is the real time capability. Therefore it is a challenge to create simple but accurate models, that enable a fast calculation of the wanted values. In this paper both models, the HVAC and the single zone passenger compartment model and their interfaces would be presented. Further results of both models interacting in a HIL-simulation on a commercial hardware platform connected via interfaces to the climate controller would be shown","","0-7803-9047-4","","10.1109/AIM.2005.1511151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511151","","Actuators;Air conditioning;Automatic control;Control systems;Costs;Hardware;Mechatronics;Road safety;Testing;Vehicle safety","HVAC;automotive engineering;control engineering computing;digital simulation;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","HVAC;automatic air conditioning system;hardware-in-the-loop-simulation;passenger compartment model;road safety;road traffic;software-in-the-loop-simulation;vehicle climate controller","","","","1","","","","","20050926","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a project that aims at automating this preliminary undercarriage inspection by using an automatic under-vehicle inspection system (AUVIS) and image processing algorithms to assist personnel in identifying vehicles for secondary inspection. The inspection system will image the undercarriage of every car in a lane as they approach the CBP agent and use a novel change detection algorithm to compare the captured image to a corresponding reference image of the vehicle's make and model.

This work begins a series of articles describing the method of assessment and prediction of electromagnetic radiation of complex, large scale, electrical objects, such as electric cars. This paper examines the influence of a vehicle hulls on an electromagnetic radiation excited by an electrical device located inside it. For this purpose, a simplified model of vehicle electronics is taken. A set of electronic devices and their enclosures can be considered as an unintentional source of electromagnetic field. The impact of hull is analyzed from this point of view. The statistic estimation gives an account of how the hull changes the field strength, and what is the new direction of the main field pattern lobe. Typical resonant frequencies of the hull and Q-factor are considered, as well as various positions inside the car where the electronics can cause potential electromagnetic compatibility problems. Although the estimation is not absolutely precise, the simplified model gives a comprehensive assessment of the electronics emission. The goal is to find out whether the car hull and electronics inside can be still considered as an unintentional emitter, to compare the radiation characteristics with the unintentional emitter model and to know limitations of this approach. Results obtained from the analysis are used in a methodology aimed at prediction of the system-level emission on the basis of component-level emission measurements. However, they can be used in making rapid measurement and radiation prediction methods, which are required at a design and vehicle prototyping stage, etc. in software like rule-checking or expert systems.","","978-1-4673-3060-2","","10.1109/EEEIC.2013.6549529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549529","Q-factor;automotive EMC;directivity;electromagnetics;resonant frequencies","","Q-factor;automotive electronics;electromagnetic compatibility;statistical analysis","Q-factor;electrical device;electromagnetic compatibility problems;electromagnetic radiation;electronics emission;expert systems;field pattern lobe;field strength;radiated emission;radiation characteristics;radiation prediction methods;software like rule checking;statistic estimation;vehicle design process;vehicle electronics;vehicle hull","","","","0","","16","","","20130701","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The root causes of the faults include hardware components such as actuators, software within the controllers (ECUs), or the interactions between hardware and software, i.e., between controllers and plants. These faults, originating from various interactions and especially between hardware and software, are particularly challenging to address. Our basic strategy is to divide the fault universe of the cyber-physical system in a hierarchical manner, and monitor the critical variables/signals that have impact at different levels of interactions. Diagnostic matrix is established to represent the relationship between the faults and the test outcomes (also known as fault signatures). A factorial hidden Markov model-based inference algorithm, termed dynamic multiple fault diagnosis, is used to infer the root causes based on the observed test outcomes. The proposed diagnostic strategy is validated on an electrical power generation and storage system controlled by two ECUs in an environment with CANoe/MATLAB co-simulation. Eleven faults are injected with the failures originating in actuator hardware, sensor, controller hardware, and software components (sensor faults are not considered in this paper). The simulation results show that the proposed diagnostic strategy is effective in addressing the interaction-caused faults.","1083-4435","","","10.1109/TMECH.2012.2214397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6302201","Automotive systems;CANoe;cyber-physical systems;dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD);electrical power generation and storage system (EPGS);electronic control units (ECUs);fault diagnosis;fault modeling;hierarchical tests;sympathetic faults;test design","Automotive engineering;Energy storage;Fault diagnosis;Hierarchical systems;Power generation","automotive electrics;electric power generation;energy storage;fault diagnosis;hidden Markov models","CANoe-Matlab co-simulation;ECUs;EPGS;actuators;automotive control system;automotive electric power generation and storage system;controller hardware;cyber-physical system;diagnostic matrix;dynamic multiple fault diagnosis;electronic control units;factorial hidden Markov model-based inference algorithm;fault detection technique;fault isolation techniques;software components;vehicle systems","","","","1","","26","","2012-09-13","20131211","","IEEE","ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The virtual platform constitutes the foundation for design decisions early in the development phase, therefore enabling decisive and competitive advantages in the development process. This paper focuses on one of the key-enablers of the methodology, the universal communication model (UCM). The UCM is defined at a level of abstraction that allows accurate estimates of the performance including the latencies over the bus network, and good simulation performance.

The variability mechanism centric approach for process family architecture modeling allows for representing explicitly and intuitively the variability in a process family architecture and supports the effective reuse of process family architecture parts for the process family members. Moreover, it allows to model the implementation of variability in the process family and thus to take into account the influence of the variability implementation on the non-functional properties of the process family during process family architecture design.

We simulate the process with models of the three-dimensional geometry of the multicomponent moulding, which have a minimum distance of core back of 1.5 mm(second component), and study the variation of different process parameters as this core back increased. From the CAE analysis, the optimum process parameters are obtained with the optimal distance of core back of 2.0 mm.

Although there is necessity for thourough testing, exhaustive validiation and verification is hardly possible in industry due to time and resource restrictions. In the past the reason for this has often been that it was to time-consuming to specify, to execute, and to evaluate test cases for the first design models and the integrated embedded system. In the meantime methods have become popular in industry that allow the automated generation, execution, and evaluation of test cases. In order to be able to automate these steps all necessary information must be integrated into the models that are the basis for the following steps. The complexity of the system, however, makes the evaluation and assessment of the behavior of the system even more complex. The growth of information needed for this comes along with it. The integration of this information into the model which is used for the generation of test cases is hardly feasible. In this paper we describe how this issue can be addressed by the combination of reference models in MATLAB/Simulink® with test models. Time Usage Models (TUM) are employed as test models and provide the basis to generate all possible test scenarios. Model based statistical testing with consideration of time and durations is supported by TUMs. The reference models are used like an executable specification, providing information for the evaluation of the system to be tested. The test model can therefore be kept generic in order to be able to derive virtually any test case from the model, taking account of the potentially infinite sequence of inputs reactive systems might process. We applied the presented approach with a german automotive OEM for the validation and verification of the energy management system.","","978-1-4577-1078-0","","10.1109/ICSEng.2011.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6041559","Design;Embedded Systems;Real-time Systems;Reliability;Road Vehicles;Safety Critical Systems;Simulation;Software Testing","Automotive engineering;Data models;Energy management;Real time systems;Testing;Unified modeling language","automatic test pattern generation;automatic test software;automobiles;automotive electronics;embedded systems;energy management systems;formal verification;safety-critical software;statistical testing","German automotive OEM;MATLAB/Simulink;automated test case evaluation;automated test case execution;automated test case generation;embedded system validiation;embedded system verification;energy management system;integrated embedded system;meantime method;real-time embedded automotive system modeling;reference model;resource restriction;road vehicle;statistical testing;test model;time restriction;time usage model","","","","2","","17","","","20111013","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the ambiguity of natural language and the resulting absence of an automatic mechanism, this has to be done manually. Such manual validation techniques are time-consuming, error-prone, and repetitive because hundreds or thousands of requirements must be checked. With an automatic validation the requirements engineering process can be faster and can produce requirements of higher quality. To realize an automatism, we propose a controlled natural language (CNL) for the documentation of requirements. On basis of the CNL, a concept for an automatic requirements validation is developed for the identification of inconsistencies and incomplete requirements.

In this respect, the cell represents a departure from previously reported blackboard implementations. Interconnection of these modular units uses a standard interface, configured as a globally accessible blackboard. As a means of evaluation, a software implementation of the architecture is applied to the sonar perception subsystem. The image processing tools at the heart of a simple knowledge base are described, and results are presented to show a small sequence of system execution, and some examples of candidate object and shadow areas derived from real sonar images.

Proceedings.

The development of such a complex and networked system requires a coordinated, systematic development process. In this contribution a suitable process model is presented. It supports the verification of a domain model considering functional requirements in an early stage of development. The process model takes two different types of modeling into account. Object oriented modeling is used to describe domain models and particularly supports aspects like re-use, exchangeability, scalability and distributed development. Data flow oriented modeling especially focuses on dynamic aspects and is employed to create a simulation model. Coupling points are identified allowing an automated mapping of these two types of models.","1090-705X","0-7695-1465-0","","10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048530","","Automotive applications;Control system synthesis;Encapsulation;Fuel economy;Intelligent networks;Mechatronics;Object oriented modeling;Scalability;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicle safety","automated highways;automobiles;data flow analysis;formal verification;mechatronics;object-oriented methods;software reusability","data flow oriented modeling;distributed development;domain model verification;economic impact;fuel consumption;functional requirements;motor vehicles;networked mechatronic components;object oriented modeling;process model;safety;scalability;simulation model;software reuse","","","","2","","","","","20021210","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These contradicting requirements have brought about the development of hydrobushings. The operational principle of hydrobushings was introduced simply. Meanwhile, two most important dynamic characteristic parameters were illustrated. The novel and innovative model of hydrobushing was built in multi-disciplinary simulation software AMESim (Advanced Modeling and Simulation Environment for systems Engineering). The mathematical software MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) was used to process the simulation results of model in software AMESim. The dynamic characteristic tests were performed with MTS 831 servo-controlled hydraulic test rig. And experimental data are conformable to the simulation results. Therefore, it proves that virtual prototype model is correct and believable. Finally, this innovative model was used to research how the structural and related parameters have an effect on the dynamic behavior of hydrobushings.","","978-1-4244-9699-0","","10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982461","AMESim;MATLAB;dynamic behavior;hydrobushing;simulation","Data models;Harmonic analysis;Insulators;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Vehicle dynamics","bushings;digital simulation;hydraulic systems;innovation management;mathematics computing;mechanical engineering computing;vibration control;virtual prototyping","AMESim multidisciplinary simulation software;Advanced Modeling and Simulation Environment for Systems Engineering;MTS 831 servocontrol hydraulic test rig;Matlab;Matrix Laboratory;hydrobushings dynamic behavior;innovative method;shake control;structural parameters;structure borne noise isolation;virtual prototype model","","","","0","","5","","","20110811","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It not only helps define boundaries of a simulation model but also defines the complexity and resource requirements for the model. Many a times a simple looking model grows into a complex model because of incorrect choices in abstraction level. Developing the model in stages or steps of abstraction is sometimes a favored approach. In this paper we study and analyze `why' and `how' these choices in abstraction level of a simulation model at various stages in a project's life cycle results in answering the objective function more precisely. Using several automotive manufacturing case studies, We discuss the challenges relating to complexity and methodological issues, and the procedures involved in managing the same.","0891-7736","978-1-4577-2108-3","978-1-4577-2107-6","10.1109/WSC.2011.6147938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147938","","Analytical models;Assembly;Automotive engineering;Feeds;Software;Throughput","automobile manufacture;manufacturing systems;project management","automotive manufacturing;complex manufacturing systems;complex simulation models;project life cycle;simulation models","","","","0","","7","","","20120209","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical time-triggered architecture is constituted by one or more clusters. Each cluster consists of nodes communicating with one another via a time-triggered communication protocol. Designing applications to run on such a platform is a challenging task. We address this problem by constructing a UML-based design framework which exposes the essential features of the time-triggered platforms at the UML-level and allows applications to be developed at a more abstract level before full implementation. To support preliminary functional validation, we have constructed a translator by which SystemC code can be automatically generated from UML designs. Our framework enables fast prototyping of time-triggered applications and early design validation. It also supports key design principles of TTAs, such as temporal firewalls and composability.","1052-8725","978-0-7695-3062-8","","10.1109/RTSS.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408290","","Aerospace safety;Application software;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer architecture;Protocols;Prototypes;Real time systems;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;safety-critical software;software architecture","SystemC code;UML-based design framework;safety-critical real-time applications;time-triggered applications;time-triggered architectures","","","","0","","35","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
