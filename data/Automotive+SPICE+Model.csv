Original equipment manufacturers have increasingly requested SPICE certifications from their suppliers in order to effectively evaluate the development processes and identify reliable partners. To support organizations in their software process improvement effort, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed the IDEAL model. This guide is, however, influenced by the SEI's work on CMM and based on the experiences with very large organizations. The goal of this paper is to examine the suitability of the IDEAL model for the implementation of Automotive SPICE at a medium-sized R&D department. Preliminary results from an action research study at a global systems engineering company are discussed. The data indicate that adjustments are especially needed with regard to the factors participation and communication. Also, informal networks between companies, early decision-making and usability are shown to play an important role and might be added to the model.","","978-1-4673-1823-5","","10.1109/CHASE.2012.6223026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223026","Automotive-SPICE;IDEAL-Model;improvement models;software process improvement","Automotive engineering;Companies;IEC standards;ISO standards;SPICE","Capability Maturity Model;automotive engineering;decision making;research and development;software standards","CMM;IDEAL software process improvement model;ISO/IEC 15504;SEI;SPICE certifications;Software Engineering Institute;automotive SPICE Implementation;automotive industry;domain-specific model;early decision making;global systems engineering company;informal networks;medium-sized R&D department","","","","0","","17","","","20120625","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim is to compare several metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) models to find out which can be used for low-voltage, high-current automotive converter simulations. As these models are intended for system simulation, only analytical models are addressed as they may be implemented into any circuit simulator. The different modes of operation of the switches are described (commutation, synchronous rectification, avalanche...), and several models of the power MOSFET transistor, allowing for simulation in these modes, are presented. Special care is given to the parameter extraction methods and to the interconnection model of the commutation cell. The four test circuits used to identify the low-voltage power MOSFET model parameters are presented. Comparison between simulations and measurements obtained with a calorimeter are then detailed. This measurement method is accurate and offers a simple way to prove the quality of simulation results. It is shown that the parameter identification is of major concern to achieve high accuracy, as classical Spice models can give good results, providing the model parameters are correctly set","0885-8993","","","10.1109/TPEL.2006.872383","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629001","Characterization;circuit parasitics;electrothermal;model;power metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET);validation","Analytical models;Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;MOS devices;MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Power electronics;Power system modeling","automotive electronics;calorimeters;circuit testing;parameter estimation;power MOSFET;power convertors","automotive applications;commutation cell;low-voltage MOSFET;metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor;parameter extraction method;parameter identification;power MOSFET;power electronic circuits;test circuits","","","","4","","23","","","20060508","","IEEE","IEEE Power Electronics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Indeed, tools like Saber, Pspice or Simplorer are effective means for the power electronics structure time-domain studies. However, if these structures have an ac input and a high switching frequency (various time scales), or if several aspect studies are taken into account, time-domain simulation becomes painful and expensive in memory and computing time. The study of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) performances is also difficult because of the line impedance stabilizer network (LISN) time-constants which come to penalize the time-domain simulation. In addition, in sizing and optimization process, results in short computing times are needed, so the time-domain simulation may be too time consuming. In this way, the paper proposes to carry out a compromise between the model accuracy and the tool rapidness and recommends the use of analytical models to optimize the passive element volume of static converters by respecting EMC standards, by minimizing the whole dissipated losses (conduction and switching semiconductor losses, core and copper inductor losses, capacitor losses) and by constraining the semiconductor junction, the winding and the magnetic circuit temperatures. This optimization approach is applied to a 42 V-14 V dc-dc converter for the automotive domain (output power 1 kW). The developed optimization procedure is validated by numerical simulation and measures.","","0-7803-7906-3","","10.1109/IECON.2003.1280301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280301","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Constraint optimization;DC-DC power converters;Design optimization;Electromagnetic compatibility;Impedance;Power electronics;Switching frequency;Time domain analysis","DC-DC power convertors;SPICE;electromagnetic compatibility;losses;optimisation;time-domain analysis","42 to 14 V;dedicated optimization tool;electromagnetic compatibility performances;line impedance stabilizer network;power electronics structure;static converters;synchronous DC-DC converter;time-constants;time-domain simulation","","","","3","","18","","","20040405","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To optimize the performance, we combined a synchronous demodulation strategy with an external resonance filter serving both as clock reference and noise protection. This filter was extended by an additional low-pass easing implementation of the demodulator and compensating for internal signal delays. For system simulation, a simple analytical model based on Fourier synthesis was found to be superior to a conventional SPICE simulation.

To this end, an interface between the two simulators SLSim and SMASH has been developed that links the slave simulator to the master process during runtime. Both simulator cores work independently of each other and the synchronization, which means data exchange, is done at adaptively calculated points in time. Since a mixed-signal simulator consists of an analog and a logic algorithm which are stepped independently through time, synchronization not only means data exchange between the both simulators, but also data exchange between the analog and the logic part of the VHDL-AMS simulator. Due to that, special attention has to be given to the synchronization mechanisms of the simulator interface. The functionality of the co-simulation will be shown by using examples from the field of automotive EMC simulation.","","1-4244-1448-2","1-4244-1449-0","10.1109/ISSSE.2007.4294417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4294417","SPICE;VHDL-AMS;automotive EMC simulation;circuit simulation","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Circuit simulation;Electromagnetic compatibility;Equivalent circuits;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic;Master-slave;SPICE;Transient analysis","SPICE;circuit simulation;hardware description languages;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","SLSim simulators;SMASH simulators;SPICE netlists;VHDL-AMS models;data exchange;mixed-signal language;simulator coupling;simulator interface;synchronization mechanisms;transient time simulation","","","","0","","10","","","20070827","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To predict the IGBTpsilas loss and thermal response, especially in the case of adverse dynamic conditions, the dynamic loss model and the junction temperature of power IGBT are studied in this paper. This model is then applied to simulate the loss of Eupecpsilas power IGBT FS450R12KE3 used in a motor driving system for electric vehicles developed by the Institute of Electrical Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences.

These converters are constituted by a basic commutation cell (Inductor-MOS transistor-diode-capacitor) managed by an integrated circuit realizing voltage and current control typically running between 100 and 500 kHz. This control's frequency creates high conducted Electromagnetic noise which could cause troubles on the supply network. We propose to use a SPICE modeling to estimate the conducted noise on supply network during CISPR 25 CE measurements.

This approach enables engineers to have a better insight into LED critical performance parameters in various operating conditions, by considering the main electrical-thermal and optical interactions. Our proposed multi-domain model integrates an electrical model based on typical diode equations, a dynamic thermal model composed of a Cauer type RC network driven by currnet source, and an optical model derived from the forward current and junction temperature variations of the total luminous flux. The presented approach offers three significant advantages over the traditional single-domain modeling: the effects of packaging and board level thermal management can be evaluated in correlation with electrical parameters, the self heating effect of the junction can be analyzed in the time domain, and the variation of luminous flux output can be observed. The model is defined based on SPICE circuit elements and can be used with any conventional SPICE circuit solver, without the need for solver algorithm modification. The inputs necessary for defining the model are based on standard LED measurements and are often specified in the manufacturer's datasheets.

A novel transient thermal model for the fast calculation of temperature fields and hot spot temperature evolution presented recently is extended to include time-dependent boundary conditions for variations of ambient temperature and surface heat flows. For this a Green's function representation of the temperature field is used. Also, general initial temperature conditions are included. The method is exemplified by application to a dc/ac converter module for automotive hybrid drives. The thermal model, which can be represented by a thermal equivalent circuit, then is combined with an electrical PSpice-metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) model to allow for the fully self-consistent electrothermal circuit simulation of 42-V/14-V dc/dc-converter modules. 670 converter periods with altogether 8000MOSFET switching cycles in the six-chip module can be simulated within 1-h computing time on a Pentium PC. Various simulation results are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility of the simulation method and allow for the optimization of converter losses.

Regarding hybrid or electrical vehicles the dissipated thermal power of these new functions can be significant. Therefore, the thermal analysis is now essential for peak and thermal cycle amplitudes prediction which are the main driving factors for equipment reliability. The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Software is becoming increasingly common to perform this kind of analysis. Unfortunately, when quick response is needed to trade off between several design solutions, when complex power profiles have to be addressed or when non linear effects of temperature have to be considered in power loss prediction (electro-thermal simulation), the CFD solution is sometimes of little help. The paper describes a methodology which allows to perform a thermal analysis in a reduced time. Simulation time reduction is based on simplification of the thermal model by focusing analysis on a reduced number of points (power injection points and observed temperatures). 3D model using millions of cells is converted into a “0D” or “mesh less” model using a few tens of points.","","978-1-61284-814-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730668","","Analytical models;Computational fluid dynamics;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;SPICE;Temperature sensors;Transfer functions","automobile industry;automotive electronics;hybrid electric vehicles;reliability;road safety;thermal analysis","3D model;CFD software;automotive industry;computational fluid dynamics;embedded electronic functions;equipment reliability;fuel consumption reduction;hybrid or electrical vehicles;nonlinear temperature effects;power loss prediction;road car safety;simulation time reduction;thermal cycle amplitude prediction;thermal model analysis;thermal power dissipation;thermal pre-dimensioning methodology","","","","0","","4","","","20110314","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Schematic design and thermal management are rarely correlated, although electrical and thermal parameters are very closely linked. Poor thermal design can have severe consequences on the reliability and functionality of the equipment and is often the main cause of component failure. As power density increases on the printed circuit board this problem becomes critical. Our paper presents a method of mixing electrical and thermal simulation with the goal of improving functional parameters and thermal stress behavior. Switching-mode power supply circuits have high power density and are likely to fail due to thermal stress, so as a support application for our method we will use a boost switching-mode power supply designed for automotive use.","","978-1-4244-8123-1","","10.1109/SIITME.2010.5650828","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5650828","design flow;electrothermal simulation;spice model;thermal model","Capacitors;Integrated circuit modeling;Junctions;Layout;Optimization;Resistors;Temperature distribution","optimisation;switched mode power supplies;thermal management (packaging)","boost switching mode power supply;electronic equipment;electrothermal modeling;optimization;thermal management;thermal simulation","","","","1","","12","","","20101203","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
