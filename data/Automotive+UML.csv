Accordingly, the size and complexity of ECU software also increased, and these give rise to various challenges to automotive software engineers. They need a new approach and tools to meet these challenges. Model-Based development is a choice. This paper presents a model-based design approach for the development of AMT (Automated Manual Transmission) ECU software using UML-RT language in automotive domain. UML-RT is a modeling language tailored to the demands of real-time software. The paper shows the methods and process on modeling functional and architectural model using UML-RT key diagram. Conclusions are drawn on how these models helps the different developers visualize, construct, and discuss together the structure and behavior of software's architecture.","","978-1-4244-7324-3","978-89-88678-22-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542946","ECU Software;Model-Based;UML-RT;automotive engineering;software modeling","Actuators;Application software;Automatic control;Automotive engineering;Driver circuits;Embedded software;Gears;Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;Vehicles","","","","","","0","","11","","","20100809","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, since all works including the communication about design, data, constraint, performance between supplier and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) are only document-driven, such document-driven development (DDD) process has some intrinsic problems.

Proceedings of the 4th International Conference","22-25 Oct. 2006","2006","","","2","2","In this tutorial, an overview of automotive electronic systems and details of the development methodologies are presented. Automobiles were born to enhance human mobile performance. In early development stage, automotive engineers focused to strengthen automobile engine power. Afterwards, automobiles had enough function to drive faster than any animal, but they caused some social problems such as traffic accidents, environmental problems and traffic congestions. Automotive electronic technologies have been developed in order to solve these social problems. Roles of electronic technologies on automobile functional developments For the solution to safely, environment and traffic problems, various functions are necessary which could not be completed only by mechanical systems. In this section, roles of automobile electronic systems on countermeasures to the social problems are discussed. Vehicle motion control systems, power-train control systems, navigation systems, and advanced drive assist systems are introduced and automotive functions are defined. Design requirement for automotive electronic systems architecture Electronic systems composed basically of sensors, ECU's (Electronic Control Units), actuators and human interfaces. In early days, each electronic system was designed independently. Today's automobile has various functions which could be completed by multiple electric systems. Therefore, fundamental architecture of integrated electronic systems in an automobile is important to be designed in order to optimize the total function, cost and productivity. Design and development procedure of electronic systems and software In vehicle systems and software, required functions and complexity of products are increasing. In this situation, ECU suppliers are working with efficient development methodology to achieve the highest quality. Today most common development processes are still classical V shaped process, module design and C language programming. However, se- - veral new technologies such as UML design method are tried and some of them are adopted as the standard process. Automatic testing and simulation environment are also important for the development procedure. Automotive Local Area Network Recently more and more automotive equipment are controlled electronically and the number of ECU's is increasing. The number of wire harnesses is also increasing and many problems such as the increase of weight, lack of installation space and difficulty of handling are experienced. As the solution of these problems, multiplexing with automotive Local Area Network is important to secure high speed communication as well as to decrease the weight and volume of wire harnesses. We will review technologies of automotive Local Area Network from CAN and LIN, which are currently de facto standards, to FlexRay that is about to start being adopted.","","1-59593-370-0","1-59593-370-0","10.1145/1176254.1176256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278480","automotive electronics","Automobiles;Automotive electronics;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Humans;Local area networks;Motion control;Software systems;Space technology;Wire","automotive electronics;engines;local area networks;motion control;velocity control","C language programming;UML design method;advanced drive assist systems;automobile engine power;automotive electronic software;automotive electronic system;automotive local area network;electronic control units;human interfaces;mechanical systems;navigation systems;power train control systems;social problems;vehicle motion control systems;wire harnesses","","","","0","","","","","20070730","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has led to an increased emphasis on setting up a validation flow over UML that can be used to guarantee the correctness of UML models. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Assertion-based verification (ABV) framework for validation of UML Statecharts over the Rhapsody platform of I-logix. We present an extension of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), named Action-LTL that allows assertions to be specified over data attributes and events of UML models. We present a methodology for automatic generation of Rhapsody Statecharts from Action-LTL specifications. These generated Statecharts are added as simulation observers to an existing UML model to detect specification violations during simulation. In view of the capacity limitations of existing formal assertion-based verification tools, we believe that our methods are of immediate practical value to the UML-based design community.","","978-1-4244-2408-5","978-1-4244-2409-2","10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4766503","","Application software;Automata;Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Hardware design languages;Software safety;Specification languages;State-space methods;Unified modeling language;Vehicle dynamics","Unified Modeling Language;formal specification;program verification;temporal logic","I-logix Rhapsody platform;UML statechart;Unified Modeling Language;action-LTL specification;data attribute;dynamic assertion-based verification platform;linear temporal logic","","","","0","","12","","","20090127","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

As any abstract syntax, UML profiles evolve through time. As UML profiles are used for models definition, their evolutions may have a direct impact on them.

In this paper, we deal with reducing the cost of models adaptation fitting the conducted evolution of the UML profiles. We want to offer a pattern-based solution to recurrent evolution problems. So, we specify evolution patterns in four aspects: the sequence of change operations needed to describe an evolution, the classification according to the evolution impact, a reusable solution for each category and, finally, the relations towards other evolution patterns.

The major challenges in the automotive test data management domain include coping with a huge amount of data produced, considering their long lifetime, and trying to re-use as much as possible of the already acquired knowledge. For this purpose the automotive standards organization ASAM (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) has specified a storage standard called Open Data Services (ODS), which allows users to design data models fitted to their specific needs while keeping general classification information for generic use. On the other hand, object oriented concepts have evolved in the software technology domain, and UML has emerged as the most important standard to specify software-based systems. Given the similarities between the goals of ODS and aspects of UML that describe the static parts of a software system, this paper proposes a mapping between these two technologies.","","978-1-4673-4567-5","978-1-4673-4568-2","10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505865","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505865","ASAM;UML;automotive testing;data model;meta model;model mapping;standards","","Unified Modeling Language;automotive engineering;data models;object-oriented methods;software reusability;storage management;testing","ASAM automotive standard organization;Association-for-Standardization-of-Automation-and-Measuring Systems;ODS storage standard;Open Data Services;UML;Unified Modeling Language;automotive test data management domain;classification information;data model mapping;design data models;object oriented concepts;software technology domain;software-based systems;standardized automotive testing data storage","","","","0","","8","","","20130422","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

How well these tasks are performed significantly impacts the quality of the developed software system. The difficulty of these tasks is greatly exacerbated for the software of embedded systems as these systems are commonly used for critical applications, have to operate reliably for long periods of time, and usually have a high degree of complexity. Current embedded systems software development practice, however, often deals with the (requirements) analysis phase in a superficial manner, instead emphasizing design and implementation. This research investigates how an approach similar to the well-known design patterns, termed object analysis patterns, can be applied in the analysis phase of embedded systems development, prior to design and coding. Specifically, our research explores how object-oriented modeling notations, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), can be used to represent structural and behavioral information as part of commonly occurring object analysis patterns. This work also investigates how UML-based conceptual models of embedded systems, based on the diagram templates in the object analysis patterns, can be automatically analyzed using the Spin model checker for adherence to properties specified in linear-time temporal logic (LTL) using a previously developed UML formalization framework. We have applied these patterns to several embedded systems applications obtained from the automotive industry. This paper describes one of our case studies and illustrates how our approach facilitates the construction of UML-based conceptual models of embedded systems and the analysis of these models for adherence to functional requirements.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2004.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377192","","Application software;Automatic logic units;Embedded software;Embedded system;Information analysis;Object oriented modeling;Pattern analysis;Programming;Software systems;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;embedded systems;formal specification;formal verification;object-oriented methods;object-oriented programming;software quality;temporal logic","Spin model checker;Unified Modeling Language;automotive industry;behavioral information;design pattern;embedded system;linear-time temporal logic;object analysis pattern;object-oriented modeling;software development;software system;structural information","","","","13","","53","","","20050110","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Kennedy Carter, along with its partners in two EU-funded research programs, has accepted the challenge of creating the definitive integrated development environment for embedded automotive software for the first decade of this century (2000-2010). The vision that informs these two projects is the need for an integrated development environment conforming to an open systems/software architecture. Part of that vision is that the algorithmic, control theoretic emphasis of much software development in the automotive industry hitherto will not be sufficient to manage the scale and complexity of the software challenge that the industry faces. Thus, tools such as MATRIXx and MatLab must be augmented by tools which have been proven in large scale telecommunications and aerospace projects and which support the separation of concerns, rapid prototyping, co-design and code generation. Kennedy Carter is now able to offer an integrated development environment (IDE), comprising the I-UML, I-SIM/RT and I-CCG products. Used in conjunction with MATRIXx from Integrated Systems, or MatLab/Simulink from The Mathworks, these products are able to realise the vision. The result is a development environment that offers comprehensive and flexible support for automotive system development","","","","10.1049/ic:20000227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848156","","","","","","","","0","1","","","","20020806","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

Our educational material can cover both, the concept of real-time OS and implementation of application. Usually we evaluate real-time OS with using microprocessor boards. However, microcomputer boards are difficult to keep using as educational materials because companies of microcomputer boards often change their specification of boards or discontinue products. Therefore, we use cygwin, which is UNIX environment working on Microsoft Windows OS, for simulation environment. Students do not need to prepare any actual equipment. We choose OSEK/VDX OS for real-time OS. Students can work OSEK/VDX OS on cygwin. We developed “Live cygwin” which can execute cygwin applications directly from CD ROM without installing on the PC. OSEK/VDX is an open standard specification developed for automotive embedded software in Europe. As executable code of OSEK/VDX OS on cygwin environment, we use TOPPERS ATK. TOPPERS ATK (Automotive Kernel) is open source code implemented of OSEK/VDX OS by TOPPERS (Toyohashi Open Platform for Embedded Real-Time Systems). And we developed UML documentations of OSEK/VDX OS.

"Moving From Federated to Integrated Architectures in Automotive: The Role of Standards, Methods and Tools","Di Natale, M.; Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A.L.","ReTiS Lab., Scuola Superiore Sant''Anna, Pisa, Italy","Proceedings of the IEEE","April 2010","2010","98","4","603","620","Cost pressure, flexibility, extensibility and the need for coping with increased functional complexity are changing the fundamental paradigms for the definition of automotive and aeronautics architectures. Traditional designs are based on the concept of a <i>Federated Architecture</i> in which integrated hardware/software components [Electronic Control Units (ECUs)] realize mostly independent or loosely interconnected functions. These components are connected by bus and cooperate by exchanging messages. This paradigm is now being replaced by the <i>Integrated Architecture</i>, - the concept comes from Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) introduced by the avionics community (see C. B. Watkins and R. Walter, ?Transitioning from federated avionics architectures to integrated modular avionics?, in Proc. 26th Digital Avionics Syst. Conf., Oct. 2007) but it is certainly general and applicable to other fields and in particular, automotive - in which software components can be supplied from multiple sources, integrated on the same hardware platform or physically distributed and possibly moved from one CPU to another without loss of functional and time correctness and providing a guaranteed level of reliability. This shift will decouple software design from the hardware platform design and provide opportunities for the optimization of the architecture configuration, increased extensibility, flexibility and modularity. However, the integration of software components in a distributed system realizing a complex functional behavior and characterized by safety, time and reliability constraints requires a much tighter control on the component model and its semantics, new methods and tools for analyzing the results of the composition, whether by simulation or formal methods, and methods for exploring the architecture solution space and optimizing the configuration. We provide a general overview of existing challenges and possible solutions to the design and analysis problem, <i>with - - special focus on the automotive domain</i>. The development of such methods and tools must necessarily consider compatibility with existing modeling languages and standards, including UML, AUTOSAR and synchronous reactive models, on which the widely used commercial products Simulink and SCADE are based.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2039550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440059","Architecture;automotive electronic system;automotive software;design methodology;design space exploration;system design","","automotive electronics;computational complexity;electronic engineering computing;reliability;software engineering","ECU;IMA;aeronautics architectures;architecture configuration;automotive architectures;cost pressure;distributed system;electronic control units;exchanging messages;extensibility;federated architectures;flexibility;functional complexity;functional correctness;fundamental paradigms;hardware components;hardware platform design;integrated architectures;integrated modular avionics;optimization;software components;synchronous reactive models;time correctness","","","","14","","70","","","20100329","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To cope with this issue we introduce a formal interchange language, Extended Function-block Graphs (XFG), for modeling and analysis of ERT behaviors.

One approach is to enhance the ldquointelligencerdquo of modern cars in anticipating dangerous driving situations. Besides wireless communications with the traffic environment, context perception enabled by well-known technologies such as radar, laser or video is regarded as a promising instrument in driver assistance and collision avoidance. There is a rich variety of both hardware configurations of automotive environment sensor systems and strategies for sensor data fusion and processing. For sensor systems assembled of multiple devices, the trade-off between increased spatial coverage, robustness against interfering factors and accuracy of measured data is a crucial aspect of system design. We investigate up-to-date automotive sensor systems with respect to detection performance and detection quality. We built UML-based discrete-event simulation models to resemble sensors, context perception, signal processing and data fusion in realistic road traffic scenarios. Our results allow for a sound comparison on sensor systems and data acquisition strategies at an early stage of system development.","","978-1-4244-3822-8","978-1-4244-2957-8","10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4762047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762047","Automotive Applications;Driver Assistance;Environment Sensors;Sensor Data Fusion;Simulation","Automotive engineering;Context;Government;Laser radar;Manufacturing;Roads;Robustness;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Wireless communication","automotive electronics;collision avoidance;driver information systems;sensor fusion","automotive environment sensor systems;collision avoidance;driver assistance;sensor data fusion","","","","1","","14","","","20090123","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a UML-based methodology combining both approaches. The prototyped application consists of a main component or ""application component"" and a set of external components representing the environment.

This extension is realized by a UML profile. A model-based approach is presented aiming at the definition of a so-called Application Replication View, in which a replication strategy is specified for safety critical application components. A separate model, called Application Timing View, defines timing constraints for system responses. The combination of the two views will enable schedulability analysis of the fault-tolerant application. Schedulability analysis considers the task set composed of application tasks and the additional tasks injected by replication.

The goal is to cover in a more suitable manner a particular application domain (e.g. automotive) or specific concerns (e.g. hardware modeling) or even to focus on a given class of practitioners. In this respect, two design approaches are generally opposed which respectively propose to define domain-specific modeling languages from scratch or to customize an existing general-purpose language. This paper focuses on the latter approach and claims that UML profiles do provide handy and powerful mechanisms to design domain-specific modeling languages but are penalized by lacks of methodological guidelines and tool support. To cope with these lacks, a profile design approach is introduced, which includes a methodological framework to structure profiles design process and tool support to partly automate this process.","1089-6503","978-0-7695-3784-9","","10.1109/SEAA.2009.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349876","Domain-Specific Modeling Languages;Model-Driven Engineering;UML;profiles","Application software;Automotive engineering;Embedded system;Guidelines;Hardware;Laboratories;Model driven engineering;Process design;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;software engineering","UML profiles;domain-specific modeling languages design;model-driven engineering","","","","3","","26","","","20091208","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a methodical approach to evaluate architecture concepts with regard to standard analysis methods as well as application specific evaluation techniques. We use UML to define the meta-model structure of the system architecture, model the instances of the meta-model using EMF and a generated graphical editor, and perform evaluation operations with the help of an MDE framework.

In such systems, requirements are of different nature (software-related, system-related, functional or non functional) and must be traced through a multilevel design flow which integrates multiple tools and heterogeneous models. Validation and Verification (V&V) activities must be performed on models and on the final product to check whether they match the initial requirements. Results of design and V&V activities must be able to impact traceability information. We thus propose DARWIN4REQ, a metamodel for requirement traceability, based on three independent flows (requirement model, solution model and V&V model). The new metamodel establishes a link between these flows and affords full traceability of requirements, including those set for heterogeneous models. This paper presents the DARWIN4REQ metamodel and its use in the context of heterogeneous models for requirements modeling, design and V&V.

Our approach is based on symbolic transition systems (STSs) and overcomes the intricacies resulting from straightforward application of enumerative test models (e.g. state space explosion). The derivation of the test sequences is performed by searching paths through the STS models with respect to their communication structure. By calculating the weakest preconditions of these paths the validity of the paths (and their related parameters) is ensured. Notably, our first empirical results on an industry showcase - a flashing indicator model developed with our industry partner - indicate that our model composition approach is applicable for both - systematic as well as randomized test case generation.","1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4","978-0-7695-4131-0","10.1109/QSIC.2010.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562951","UML state chart;black-box testing;symbolic execution;symbolic sransition system","Cost accounting;History;Industries;Junctions;Software;Testing;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;automobile industry;multimedia computing;program testing;software quality;symbol manipulation","UML state charts;automotive industry;industrial application;multimedia solutions;product quality;state space explosion;symbolic transition systems;test sequence generation","","","","5","","15","","","20100907","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, automobile enterprises are looking for a technology facilitating effective development and agile production of products. This paper describes an implementation of laser welding system for automobile side panels with digital manufacturing. At first, the physical and logical schema and behavior of assembly system for welding side panels are analyzed using IDEFO and UML diagram.

Since the application area for the development of such systems is very broad, e.g. including automotive, aeronautics, robotics or consumer products and much more, on top the need for flexible and adaptable methods for the development of such systems arises as well. Such complex, interdisciplinary systems are also called mechatronic systems, referring to the synergistic integration of software, electronics and mechanics. To approach the complexity inherent in the discipline-spanning aspect, different development and integrations methods and techniques coming from the involved disciplines are applied. Especially the interdisciplinary aspect of mechatronics, makes it difficult to handle such development and still there is no such thing as a promoted unified mechatronic modeling and design language, which is capable of describing a joint model with sufficient details to manage the large number of involved system-aspects included in each of the representative domains-specific disciplines. In order to obtain a coherent model from the entire mechatronic system, an integrated model framework capable to manage various requirements and modeling specifications present in each discipline is needed. This paper will provide a comprehensive review regarding the evolution of design methodologies for mechatronic systems, investigate recent research approaches in the realm of model-based design, and also point out the problems and limitations inherent in the different concepts and finally summarize the most promising research directions.","","978-1-4673-2347-5","","10.1109/MESA.2012.6275567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275567","Mechatronic Component;Model Integrated Mechatronics;SysML;System Modeling;Systems Engineering;UML;modeling techniques","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Mechatronics;Object oriented modeling;Solid modeling;Unified modeling language","mechatronics;product design","aeronautics product;automotive product;consumer product;design methodology;electronics;engineering approach;mechanics;mechatronic design concept;model-based design;robotics product;software;system development","","","","0","","31","","","20120823","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presented framework contains four internal metamodels. Firstly, a metamodel specifies the abstract syntax of the model language. Secondly, another metamodel specifies the particular elements for the connection-based languages. Thirdly, a metamodel specifies the spatial information. At last, a metamodel defines the necessary elements for the CASE tools. Each internal metamodel can be changed without having effect on the others. These four internal metamodels can be combined in several ways (denoted as configurations). Each configuration has its particular scope. The presented framework has been already used for defining the INGENIAS language and modernising the INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK).

Major reasons include: (1) the need for quality assurance for increasingly complex systems, (2) the emerging model-centric development paradigm, e.g., UML and MDA, with its seemingly direct connection to testing, and (3) the advent of test-centered development methodologies. Model-based testing relies on execution traces of behavior models. They are used as test cases for an implementation: input and expected output. This complements the ideas of model-driven testing. The latter uses static models to derive test drivers to automate test execution. This assumes the existence of test cases, and is, like the particular intricacies of OO testing, not in the focus of this tutorial. We cover major methodological and technological issues: the business case of model-based testing within model-based development, the need for abstraction and inverse concretization, test selection, and test case generation. We (1) discuss different scenarios of model-based testing, (2) present common abstractions when building models, and their consequences for testing, (3) explain how to use functional, structural, and stochastic test selection criteria, and (4) describe today's test generation technology.

Along with software and systems design techniques the concern of requirements management methodologies has been continuously increasing, with the aim of improving the overall development process. As a combination of both model based design techniques and requirements management methodologies, a new kind of requirements engineering methodology has been established. However, due to the complexity of this methodology and the high degree of informal aspects a unique and integrated methodology for requirements engineering is still needed.

Based on over ten years of research and application the approach forms the basis of ACSE (Atego Context-based Systems Engineering). Many traditional approaches to systems modeling represent systems as high-level blocks and then show subsystems using aggregation and composition; providing a representation of a system as a structured hierarchy. This paper suggests that this structure-based approach is unrealistic and unreliable and proposes a context-based approach to systems modeling. Contexts represent systems from particular stakeholder's points of view; it is suggested that a combination of these contexts are used as a basis for systems modeling and, hence, understanding. Following this it is suggested that system of systems can be represented in this way, by defining higher-level contexts. This is illustrated thought a simple example demonstrating the principle of context-based system engineering.","","978-1-4244-8197-2","","10.1109/SYSOSE.2010.5544037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5544037","Context-based systems engineering;SysML;UML;system of systems","Automotive engineering;Best practices;Context modeling;ISO standards;Navigation;Poles and towers;Robots;Systems engineering and theory;Unified modeling language;Vehicles","systems engineering","Atego context based systems engineering;structure based approach;system-of-systems modeling","","","","2","","6","","","20100809","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A simulation of a vehicle concept with both models will be described and investigated by means of an advanced simulation tool - the SmartElectricDrives (SED) Library - and a Modelica/Dymola simulation environment. The SED library provides the most important electric drive types including controlled electric machines which are described by algebraic and differential equations. Due to this kind of modelling, the machines provide higher flexibility in case of parameter variation and a more realistic behaviour. With the aim of achieving the highest efficiency possible for the automotive drive, which means finding an optimal setting regarding fuel and power consumption, it is necessary to simulate the entire drive train of the vehicle. This includes the internal combustion engine (ICE) as well as electric traction machines or additional electric auxiliary drives. These vehicle simulations may be performed by the car manufacturer to obtain specifications for the vehicle components to be constructed by fulfilling the given boundary conditions like electric machines speed, power and torque and therefore the resulting currents and voltages for the optimal dimensioning of each component.","","978-0-7803-9760-6","978-0-7803-9761-3","10.1109/VPPC.2007.4544221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4544221","","Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Differential equations;Electric machines;Energy consumption;Fuels;Intelligent vehicles;Libraries;Permanent magnet machines;Vehicle driving","differential equations;electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;permanent magnet machines;synchronous motor drives;traction motor drives","Modelica-Dymola simulation environment;SmartElectricDrives Library;advanced simulation tool;automotive applications;differential equations;electric auxiliary drives;electric drives;electric traction machines;fuel consumption;internal combustion engine;permanent magnet synchronous machines;power consumption;vehicle drive train","","","","5","","7","","","20080617","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the charging and billing of such advanced services. Customers of complex real-time services want real-time billing information to manage their expenses while using such services. Similarly, service providers want to manage their financial risks. Determining the actual charge during a service session implies that most of the billing processes need to be executed in near real-time. Advanced services will be composed of services provided by various 3rd party providers residing in different domains. Hence, charging and billing of advanced services requires a billing system capable of composing charging and billing information from providers in different domains on a near real-time basis. We present an architecture for such a real-time, multi-domain billing system. This paper presents an enterprise model for real-time inter-domain billing, comprising the role of the end-user, subscriber, the service provider, the 3rd party provider, and the billing provider.

Since they equally refer to software and hardware components in which they are implemented, these models call for more heterogeneous design languages, with a larger granularity range too. At the level of design and verification languages, some standards have risen up, like UML, AADL, but none of them is driven by a standard methodology. To be able to follow the requirements traceability, at each step of the life cycle, we need a methodology that states for bidirectional links between each granularity level and each development level. In this article, we propose an approach based on systematic reuse of low-level concepts (borrowed from an algorithm language like +CAL and a programming language like Ada) into encapsulated algorithm structures which are implemented into the highest conceptual levels of development (e.g. from the UML and AADL component models). These structures are only activated and enriched as they advanced with the life cycle. Therefore, some new concepts presents from the beginning of the design, will play an important role in the further development steps without being explicitly expressed from the beginning.","","0-7695-2895-3","","10.1109/ICECCS.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276335","","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Computer languages;Design engineering;Design methodology;Domain specific languages;Hardware;Real time systems;Unified modeling language;Yarn","formal specification;formal verification;software architecture;specification languages","RT architecture;hardware components;heterogeneous design languages;requirements traceability;software components;verification languages","","","","0","","12","","","20070723","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Activity diagram of the service composition was built, including milling service, drilling service, exception handling, event handling and compensation mechanism. Finally, the composition verification result showed that the proposed approach was feasible.","","978-1-4673-5533-9","","10.1109/CCDC.2013.6561422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6561422","Calculus for Orchestration of Web service;Cloud manufacturing;Formal verification;Modeling;Service composition","Calculus;Cows;Formal verification;Manufacturing;Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;Web services","Unified Modeling Language;Web services;XML;cloud computing","COWS;MagicDraw software;UML activity diagram;XML file;calculus for orchestration of Web Service;cloud manufacturing service composition modeling;compensation mechanism;composite service;composition verification;drilling service;event handling;exception handling;formal verification;milling service;unified modeling language","","","","0","","21","","","20130718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We therefore analyze the role of variability mechanisms in process family architectures and define a set of variability mechanisms for process family architectures represented as a UML activity diagram. The variability mechanism centric approach for process family architecture modeling allows for representing explicitly and intuitively the variability in a process family architecture and supports the effective reuse of process family architecture parts for the process family members. Moreover, it allows to model the implementation of variability in the process family and thus to take into account the influence of the variability implementation on the non-functional properties of the process family during process family architecture design. Our approach thus supports a more model-driven variability implementation in process family engineering","","0-7695-2546-6","","10.1109/ECBS.2006.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607378","","Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Consumer electronics;Enterprise resource planning;Power engineering and energy;Process design;Software systems;Systems engineering and theory;Technological innovation;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;software architecture","UML activity diagram;Unified Modeling Language;model-driven variability implementation;process family architecture design;process family architecture modeling;process family engineering;process oriented software;variability mechanism centric process","","","","3","","30","","","20060410","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The present work proposes a computerized method that interprets the characteristics of programs written in C++ code and applies a conversion algorithm that obtains the UML sequence diagrams. To test the method and their conversion algorithm a study case using the work carried out at Gordon College has been taken, which is an automatic teller machine simulator system written in C++","","0-7695-2569-5","","10.1109/CERMA.2006.100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019815","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Documentation;Information analysis;Object oriented modeling;Reverse engineering;Software maintenance;Software systems;Unified modeling language;Visualization","C++ language;Unified Modeling Language;object-oriented programming;reverse engineering;software maintenance;system documentation","C++ code;UML sequence diagram;automatic teller machine simulator system;conversion algorithm;meta model;program documentation;reverse engineering","","","","0","","15","","","20061204","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical time-triggered architecture is constituted by one or more clusters. Each cluster consists of nodes communicating with one another via a time-triggered communication protocol. Designing applications to run on such a platform is a challenging task. We address this problem by constructing a UML-based design framework which exposes the essential features of the time-triggered platforms at the UML-level and allows applications to be developed at a more abstract level before full implementation. To support preliminary functional validation, we have constructed a translator by which SystemC code can be automatically generated from UML designs. Our framework enables fast prototyping of time-triggered applications and early design validation. It also supports key design principles of TTAs, such as temporal firewalls and composability.","1052-8725","978-0-7695-3062-8","","10.1109/RTSS.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408290","","Aerospace safety;Application software;Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer architecture;Protocols;Prototypes;Real time systems;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;safety-critical software;software architecture","SystemC code;UML-based design framework;safety-critical real-time applications;time-triggered applications;time-triggered architectures","","","","0","","35","","","20071226","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
