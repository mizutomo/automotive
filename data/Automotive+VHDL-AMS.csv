In automotive engineering we have system design problems dealing with hydraulic or mechanic components and their controlling units, for which we expect a major advantage by introducing unified modelling to all domains. With the Brite/EuRam-Project TOOLSYS (a joined effort of automotive industry and tool makers to apply VHDL-AMS as unified modelling language on mixed-domain applications) we prove the suitability as unified modelling and interchange language for real-world systems and components. First experiments with hydraulic components reveal numerical problems on analog circuit simulators. None of the available strategies for these particularly hard problems are included by the electronic simulator makers.

This paper focuses on the radiated emissions from FlexRay communication systems, which is mainly induced by common mode current on the twisted-pair cable. VHDL-AMS modeling language is employed to investigate common mode currents in FlexRay bus networks. An equivalent common mode radiation model of a twisted-pair cable above a reference ground plane is established by simplifying it into a single transmission line parallel to ground. Through combing common mode currents as radiation source by VHDL-AMS analysis with a simplified radiation model, efficient analysis of radiated emissions from bus networks is possible. The proposed fast approaches are an analytic method and a multiple-dipole method based on Green function and mirror theory.

Both simulator cores work independently of each other and the synchronization, which means data exchange, is done at adaptively calculated points in time. Since a mixed-signal simulator consists of an analog and a logic algorithm which are stepped independently through time, synchronization not only means data exchange between the both simulators, but also data exchange between the analog and the logic part of the VHDL-AMS simulator. Due to that, special attention has to be given to the synchronization mechanisms of the simulator interface.

Our objective is to perform the in-vehicle verification, including Monte Carlo analysis, using the developed VHDL-AMS behavioral models. With this objective, we have developed the implementation of the Monte Carlo analysis through VHDL-AMS functions. The main advantage of this approach is the feature portability since it allows statistical simulation in any VHDL-AMS simulator (even if the simulator do not support statistical analysis). This paper presents the Monte Carlo implementation and reports results of the feature applied to a Flexray in-vehicle communication network.

Moreover, the dependence of dissipated power on temperature is considered. The proposed method makes it possible to obtain DCTMs with a limited number of measurements or 3D thermal simulations. The methodology to build the DCTM is based on the extraction of equivalent thermal RC network.

This paper introduces the mixed-mode behavioral model of Flexray physical layer transceiver and it presents the behavioral model verification. Several simulations were performed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, regarding signal integrity, model behavior in different bus states, wake-up pattern detection, receiver sensibility and the timing characteristics. The performance was evaluated by comparing the CPU usage time of the model (implemented in VHDL-AMS) with Spectre simulations.
